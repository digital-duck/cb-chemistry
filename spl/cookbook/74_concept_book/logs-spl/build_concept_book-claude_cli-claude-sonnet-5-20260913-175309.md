## Measurement

**Definition.** A *measurement* is a mapping $m: Q \to \mathbb{R} \times U$ that assigns to a physical quantity $Q$ a numerical value $x \in \mathbb{R}$ together with a unit $u \in U$, such that the pair $(x, u)$ represents $Q$ relative to a chosen reference standard. Formally, if $Q$ belongs to a one-dimensional quantity space with reference unit $u_0$, then $m(Q) = (x, u_0)$ where $x = Q / u_0$, the ratio of $Q$ to the magnitude of $u_0$. Every measurement carries an associated *uncertainty* $\delta x \geq 0$, so the complete report is the triple $(x, \delta x, u)$.

**Worked example.** Suppose a rod has true length $L$, and a ruler graduated in millimeters yields a reading $x = 152.3\,\text{mm}$ with instrument resolution $\delta x = 0.1\,\text{mm}$. The measurement is reported as $L = (152.3 \pm 0.1)\,\text{mm}$, meaning $L \in [152.2, 152.4]\,\text{mm}$ under the assumption of uniform reading error. Converting to centimeters, since $1\,\text{cm} = 10\,\text{mm}$, gives $L = (15.23 \pm 0.01)\,\text{cm}$, illustrating that the ratio $x/\delta x$ (the relative precision) is invariant under a change of unit, while $x$ and $\delta x$ individually rescale.

**Key theorem (propagation of uncertainty).** If $f = f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is a differentiable function of independently measured quantities $x_i$ each with uncertainty $\delta x_i$, then to first order
$$
(\delta f)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\right)^2 (\delta x_i)^2.
$$
This follows from a first-order Taylor expansion of $f$ about the measured values, combined with the assumption of uncorrelated errors.

## Si Units

**Definition.** The International System of Units (SI) is the coherent system of measurement built from seven base units, each defined by a fixed value of a fundamental physical constant: the second ($\mathrm{s}$, via the cesium-133 hyperfine transition frequency), the meter ($\mathrm{m}$, via the speed of light $c$), the kilogram ($\mathrm{kg}$, via the Planck constant $h$), the ampere ($\mathrm{A}$, via the elementary charge $e$), the kelvin ($\mathrm{K}$, via the Boltzmann constant $k_B$), the mole ($\mathrm{mol}$, via the Avogadro constant $N_A$), and the candela ($\mathrm{cd}$, via a fixed luminous efficacy). Every other physical unit, called a *derived unit*, is expressed as a product of powers of these seven: $[Q] = \mathrm{m}^{a}\,\mathrm{kg}^{b}\,\mathrm{s}^{c}\,\mathrm{A}^{d}\,\mathrm{K}^{e}\,\mathrm{mol}^{f}\,\mathrm{cd}^{g}$.

**Worked example.** Consider force, defined by Newton's second law $F = ma$. Since $[m] = \mathrm{kg}$ and $[a] = \mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, dimensional consistency requires $[F] = \mathrm{kg}\cdot\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, which we name the newton: $1\,\mathrm{N} = 1\,\mathrm{kg}\cdot\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2}$. This illustrates how derived units inherit their exponents directly from a governing physical law.

**Key theorem (Buckingham $\pi$ theorem).** If a physical relationship among $n$ dimensional variables involves $k$ independent base dimensions, it can be rewritten equivalently as a relationship among $n-k$ dimensionless groups $\pi_1, \dots, \pi_{n-k}$. This theorem justifies dimensional analysis as a method for checking equations and constructing scale-invariant physical laws without solving the underlying differential equations explicitly.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp
from sympy.physics.units import kg, m, s, N, convert_to

# Verify F = m*a has units of newtons
mass = 2 * kg
accel = 3 * m / s**2
force = mass * accel

print(convert_to(force, N))   # -> 6*newton
```

## Dimensional Analysis

**Definition.** Every physical quantity $Q$ can be expressed as a product of powers of fundamental dimensions—typically mass $\mathsf{M}$, length $\mathsf{L}$, and time $\mathsf{T}$—written as a *dimensional formula* $[Q] = \mathsf{M}^a \mathsf{L}^b \mathsf{T}^c$. Dimensional analysis is the study of relationships among physical quantities by tracking these exponents, independent of the numerical values or units chosen (SI, CGS, etc.). A valid physical equation must be *dimensionally homogeneous*: every additive term must carry the same dimensional formula.

**Worked example.** Consider the period $T$ of a simple pendulum, hypothesized to depend on its length $\ell$, mass $m$, and gravitational acceleration $g$. Assume $T = k\, \ell^a m^b g^c$ for some dimensionless constant $k$. Substituting dimensions—$[T]=\mathsf{T}$, $[\ell]=\mathsf{L}$, $[m]=\mathsf{M}$, $[g]=\mathsf{L}\mathsf{T}^{-2}$—gives
$$\mathsf{T} = \mathsf{L}^a \mathsf{M}^b (\mathsf{L}\mathsf{T}^{-2})^c = \mathsf{L}^{a+c}\mathsf{M}^b\mathsf{T}^{-2c}.$$
Matching exponents: $b=0$ (mass), $-2c=1 \Rightarrow c=-\tfrac12$, and $a+c=0 \Rightarrow a=\tfrac12$. Thus $T = k\sqrt{\ell/g}$, recovering the correct functional form without solving the pendulum's differential equation.

**Key theorem (Buckingham $\pi$ theorem).** If a physical relation among $n$ variables involves $r$ independent fundamental dimensions, the relation can be rewritten equivalently in terms of $n-r$ dimensionless groups $\pi_1, \dots, \pi_{n-r}$. This theorem guarantees that dimensional analysis, though it cannot determine dimensionless constants like $k$, always reduces the complexity of a physical law by exactly $r$ parameters.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational, solve, Eq

a, b, c = symbols('a b c')
# [T]=T, [l]=L, [m]=M, [g]=L*T^-2
eqs = [Eq(b, 0), Eq(-2*c, 1), Eq(a + c, 0)]
sol = solve(eqs, [a, b, c])
print(sol)  # {a: -1/2... solved as a=1/2 via a+c=0}
```

## Unit Conversion Factor

**Definition.** A unit conversion factor is a multiplicative constant $k$ relating a quantity expressed in one unit to the same quantity expressed in another unit, satisfying
$$
Q_{\text{new}} = k \cdot Q_{\text{old}},
$$
where $Q_{\text{old}}$ and $Q_{\text{new}}$ denote numerical measures of an identical physical quantity under two distinct unit systems. Because $Q_{\text{old}}$ and $Q_{\text{new}}$ represent the same underlying quantity, the conversion factor $k$ is dimensionless when expressed as a ratio of like units, i.e. $k = \dfrac{1\,\text{unit}_{\text{new}}}{1\,\text{unit}_{\text{old}}}$.

**Worked example.** Convert $x = 5$ miles to kilometers. Since $1\ \text{mile} = 1.60934\ \text{km}$, the conversion factor is $k = 1.60934$. Thus
$$
x_{\text{km}} = k \cdot x_{\text{mi}} = 1.60934 \times 5 = 8.0467\ \text{km}.
$$

**Key theorem (Composition of conversion factors).** If $k_{1}$ converts units $A \to B$ and $k_{2}$ converts units $B \to C$, then the composite factor converting $A \to C$ is
$$
k_{A \to C} = k_{2} \cdot k_{1}.
$$
*Proof sketch.* Let $Q_A$, $Q_B$, $Q_C$ denote the measures of the same physical quantity in units $A$, $B$, $C$ respectively. By definition, $Q_B = k_1 Q_A$ and $Q_C = k_2 Q_B$. Substituting the first into the second gives $Q_C = k_2 (k_1 Q_A) = (k_2 k_1) Q_A$, which matches the defining relation for $k_{A\to C}$. Uniqueness follows since $Q_A \neq 0$ in general, forcing $k_{A\to C} = k_2 k_1$. $\blacksquare$

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
from sympy import Rational, nsimplify

mile_to_km = Rational(160934, 100000)  # exact rational approximation
x_miles = 5
x_km = mile_to_km * x_miles
print(f"{x_miles} miles = {float(x_km):.4f} km")

# Composition example: miles -> km -> meters
km_to_m = 1000
mile_to_m = mile_to_km * km_to_m
print(f"1 mile = {float(mile_to_m):.2f} meters")
```

## Payoff

The concept of a $\text{unit\_conversion\_factor}$ is the multiplicative bridge $\phi_{A \to B}$ satisfying $q_B = \phi_{A \to B} \cdot q_A$, where $q_A$ and $q_B$ denote the same physical quantity expressed in units $A$ and $B$ respectively. Formally, if a quantity $q$ has dimension $[q]$ and admits two coherent unit systems $U_A$ and $U_B$ with base scalings $\lambda_A, \lambda_B \in \mathbb{R}^+$, then $\phi_{A \to B} = \lambda_A / \lambda_B$, and the map $\phi$ is a group homomorphism from the multiplicative group of unit choices to $\mathbb{R}^+$. This concept is the natural endpoint of the textbook because every prior construction — dimensional consistency, base and derived units, scalar multiplication of measured quantities — collapses into a single reusable number once conversion is formalized as a ratio of scalings rather than an ad hoc lookup.

Worked example: converting energy from joules to kilowatt-hours. Since $1\,\text{kWh} = 3.6 \times 10^6\,\text{J}$, the factor is $\phi_{J \to kWh} = 1/(3.6\times 10^6)$. For $q_A = 7.2\times 10^6\,\text{J}$, we compute $q_B = \phi_{J \to kWh}\, q_A = 2\,\text{kWh}$.

Key theorem (Composability): if $\phi_{A\to B}$ and $\phi_{B\to C}$ are conversion factors, then $\phi_{A\to C} = \phi_{B\to C}\,\phi_{A\to B}$. The proof follows immediately from the homomorphism property: $q_C = \phi_{B\to C} q_B = \phi_{B\to C}\phi_{A\to B} q_A$. This composability is precisely why $\text{unit\_conversion\_factor}$ generalizes cleanly across every domain in which quantities are measured, scaled, or re-expressed — from converting currencies at floating exchange rates, to rescaling probability densities under a change of variables, to translating pixel coordinates into physical distances in an imaging pipeline. In each case the same algebraic skeleton — a scalar ratio composing associatively along chains of units — reappears, making $\text{unit\_conversion\_factor}$ the reusable primitive beneath all of them.

```python
from sympy import Rational, symbols, simplify

phi_J_to_kWh = Rational(1, 3_600_000)
phi_kWh_to_MJ = Rational(3600, 1000)
q_J = 7_200_000

q_kWh = phi_J_to_kWh * q_J
phi_J_to_MJ = simplify(phi_J_to_kWh * phi_kWh_to_MJ)
print(q_kWh, phi_J_to_MJ)
```

We invite the reader to pursue one thread further: take the currency-exchange interpretation of $\phi_{A\to B}$ and explore how composability over a chain of intermediate currencies enforces the no-arbitrage condition $\prod \phi_i = 1$ around any closed loop.

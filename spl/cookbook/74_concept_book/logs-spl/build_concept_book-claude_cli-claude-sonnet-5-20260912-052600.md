## Carbon Tetravalence

Every carbon atom forms exactly four covalent bonds. This behavior, called tetravalence, follows directly from carbon's electron configuration: $1s^2\,2s^2\,2p^2$. Carbon has six electrons total, but only the four in its outer (valence) shell — two in the $2s$ orbital and two in the $2p$ orbitals — are available for bonding. To achieve a stable octet (eight valence electrons, matching the nearest noble gas, neon), carbon must gain, in effect, four more electrons by sharing them with other atoms. It does this by forming four single covalent bonds, or fewer bonds with some doubled or tripled in bond order, as long as the total bonding capacity sums to four.

Consider methane, $\text{CH}_4$. Carbon shares one electron with each of four hydrogen atoms, and each hydrogen shares its single electron back, giving carbon a full octet and each hydrogen a full duet. The same principle explains carbon dioxide, $\text{CO}_2$: carbon forms two double bonds, one with each oxygen atom. A double bond counts as two shared electron pairs, so two double bonds still total four bonds' worth of shared electrons — tetravalence is satisfied even though carbon is bonded to only two other atoms rather than four.

Tetravalence becomes a practical problem-solving tool when predicting molecular structure. Given a molecular formula, you can often deduce the connectivity by asking: how must carbon's four bonds be distributed to satisfy every atom's valence requirement? Take ethylene, $\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$. Each carbon needs four bonds total. If the two carbons form a double bond between them (using two of each carbon's four bonds), each carbon has two bonds remaining, which it uses to bond with two hydrogen atoms. This matches the formula exactly and correctly predicts the planar, double-bonded structure of ethylene, rather than, say, a single C–C bond with mismatched hydrogen counts.

This bond-counting method scales to more complex organic molecules. Before drawing a full structure, check that every carbon's bonds sum to four, every hydrogen's sum to one, and every oxygen's typically sum to two. Structures that violate this constraint are chemically impossible, making tetravalence a fast, reliable filter for eliminating incorrect candidate structures.

## Organic Compound

An organic compound is any molecule built primarily from carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen, along with common partners such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or halogens. Carbon's defining feature is its ability to form four stable covalent bonds and link to other carbon atoms in chains, branches, and rings, producing an enormous diversity of structures from a small set of elements. This is why over 20 million organic compounds are known, compared to a much smaller number of inorganic ones. Compounds lacking carbon-hydrogen bonds — like carbon dioxide, carbonates, or diamond — are classified as inorganic even though they contain carbon.

**Worked example.** Consider ethanol, $\mathrm{C_2H_6O}$, versus dimethyl ether, also $\mathrm{C_2H_6O}$. Both share the identical molecular formula, yet they behave completely differently: ethanol is a liquid that mixes with water and burns as fuel, while dimethyl ether is a gas used as a refrigerant and aerosol propellant. The difference lies in structure — ethanol has an -OH group attached to a carbon chain ($\mathrm{CH_3CH_2OH}$), while dimethyl ether has an oxygen bridging two methyl groups ($\mathrm{CH_3OCH_3}$). This illustrates a core principle of organic chemistry: molecular formula alone does not determine identity or properties — the arrangement of atoms (the structural formula) does. Compounds with the same formula but different structures are called isomers, and predicting or distinguishing them is a routine task in identifying unknown organic samples.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a chemist isolates an unknown compound with formula $\mathrm{C_3H_8O}$ and needs to determine which of three possible isomers it is: 1-propanol, 2-propanol, or methyl ethyl ether. Rather than guessing, they apply functional group tests: adding sodium metal produces bubbling hydrogen gas if an -OH group is present (both propanol isomers react; the ether does not), while oxidation with a mild oxidizer converts 1-propanol to an aldehyde but 2-propanol to a ketone — distinguishable by further chemical tests or spectroscopy. This process of narrowing down structure from formula, functional groups, and reactivity is the practical skill organic chemists use daily, whether identifying a natural product, verifying a synthesis, or characterizing an unknown environmental sample.

## Hybridization

When two atoms form a bond, the electrons involved don't simply occupy the plain $s$ and $p$ orbitals you'd predict from an atom's electron configuration. Instead, atoms often mix, or "hybridize," their atomic orbitals into a new set of equivalent orbitals better suited for bonding. Hybridization explains why methane's four C–H bonds are identical in length and angle (109.5°), even though carbon's ground-state configuration ($2s^2 2p^2$) would naively suggest two unequal bond types from unequal orbitals.

The rule is straightforward: the number of hybrid orbitals formed equals the number of atomic orbitals mixed, and that number is determined by counting the atom's electron domains (bonding groups plus lone pairs). One $s$ and three $p$ orbitals combine to form four $sp^3$ orbitals (tetrahedral, 109.5°); one $s$ and two $p$ orbitals form three $sp^2$ orbitals (trigonal planar, 120°); one $s$ and one $p$ orbital form two $sp$ orbitals (linear, 180°).

**Worked example.** Consider ethylene, $\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$. Each carbon has three electron domains: two C–H bonds and one C=C bond (a double bond counts as one domain). Three domains → $sp^2$ hybridization → trigonal planar geometry with 120° bond angles. The unhybridized $p$ orbital on each carbon, left perpendicular to the plane, overlaps sideways with its neighbor to form the $\pi$ bond of the double bond, while the $sp^2$ orbitals form the $\sigma$ framework. This is why ethylene is flat and rigid — rotation around the C=C bond would break the $\pi$ overlap.

**Problem-solving application.** Given a molecule's Lewis structure, you can predict hybridization and geometry in three steps: (1) draw the structure and count electron domains around the atom of interest, (2) match that count to a hybridization scheme (2→$sp$, 3→$sp^2$, 4→$sp^3$), and (3) assign geometry accordingly, remembering that lone pairs count as domains but aren't shown in the final molecular shape. Try this on $\text{XeF}_4$: xenon has six domains (4 bonds + 2 lone pairs), giving $sp^3d^2$ hybridization and octahedral electron geometry — but square planar molecular geometry once the two lone pairs are placed opposite each other to minimize repulsion.

## Hydrocarbon

A hydrocarbon is a molecule made of only carbon and hydrogen atoms, bonded together by covalent bonds. Carbon's ability to form four stable bonds—with other carbons or with hydrogen—lets these molecules build up as straight chains, branched chains, or rings, producing enormous structural variety from just two elements. Chemists classify hydrocarbons by bonding pattern: alkanes contain only single bonds (saturated), alkenes contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond, alkynes contain at least one triple bond, and aromatic hydrocarbons (like benzene) contain a ring of alternating or delocalized double bonds. This classification matters because bond type directly determines reactivity, melting/boiling point trends, and how the molecule burns or reacts with other substances.

**Worked example.** Consider methane ($\text{CH}_4$) and ethylene ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$). Methane is a saturated alkane—each carbon uses all four bonds to hold hydrogens, so it is chemically stable and burns cleanly:
$$\text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$
Ethylene, by contrast, has a carbon-carbon double bond, leaving it "unsaturated." That double bond is reactive: it can open up and add other atoms across it, which is exactly how ethylene molecules link together into long chains to form polyethylene plastic. The same underlying logic—single bonds are stable and unreactive, double/triple bonds are reactive sites—explains why alkanes are used as fuels while alkenes are the building blocks (monomers) of the plastics industry.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given a hydrocarbon with the formula $\text{C}_4\text{H}_8$ and asked whether it's an alkane, alkene, or cycloalkane. First check the general saturation formula for an acyclic alkane, $\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n+2}$: for $n=4$, that would be $\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}$. Since the given molecule has two fewer hydrogens, it must contain either one double bond (an alkene, matching $\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n}$) or one ring (a cycloalkane, which also fits $\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n}$)—the molecular formula alone can't distinguish them, so you'd need additional structural information, such as a reaction test with bromine water (alkenes decolorize it rapidly; cycloalkanes do not). This kind of degree-of-unsaturation reasoning is a standard first step in identifying unknown organic compounds from formula data alone.

## Alkane

An alkane is a hydrocarbon — a molecule made only of carbon and hydrogen atoms — in which every carbon-carbon bond is a single bond and every carbon atom forms as many bonds to hydrogen as its remaining valence allows. Because carbon has four bonds available and none are used for double or triple bonds or rings (in the simplest, acyclic case), alkanes are described as *saturated*: they hold the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms for a given carbon skeleton. This structural rule produces a predictable formula, $C_nH_{2n+2}$, where $n$ is the number of carbon atoms. Methane ($CH_4$), ethane ($C_2H_6$), and propane ($C_3H_8$) are the first three members of this family, and each one fits the pattern exactly.

**Worked example.** Suppose you're told a hydrocarbon contains 8 carbon atoms and is a straight-chain alkane. How many hydrogen atoms does it have? Apply the formula directly: $H = 2(8) + 2 = 18$. So the molecule is $C_8H_{18}$ — octane, the compound most associated with gasoline. Notice that the formula alone tells you the hydrogen count without needing to draw the structure, because saturation removes any ambiguity about how the bonds are arranged along a single chain.

**Problem-solving application.** The formula becomes especially useful when comparing molecules or checking whether a proposed structure is even chemically valid. For instance, if a chemist proposes a molecule with the formula $C_6H_{16}$, you can immediately flag it as impossible: for $n=6$, the maximum hydrogen count is $2(6)+2 = 14$, not 16 — there's no way to add "extra" hydrogens beyond saturation. Conversely, if a compound has fewer hydrogens than $2n+2$, it must contain a ring or a double/triple bond somewhere, since something other than single C–H and C–C bonds is using up carbon's valence. This is exactly the reasoning organic chemists use to narrow down candidate structures from a molecular formula before doing any spectroscopy: count the carbons, compute $2n+2$, and compare it to the actual hydrogen count to detect rings or unsaturation.

## Fractional Distillation

Fractional distillation is a separation technique that isolates components of a liquid mixture based on differences in their boiling points, using repeated cycles of vaporization and condensation within a single apparatus. When a mixture is heated, the component with the lower boiling point vaporizes preferentially, but because most mixtures do not separate cleanly in one pass, a fractionating column—packed with trays, beads, or mesh—provides many surfaces where rising vapor repeatedly condenses and re-vaporizes. Each cycle enriches the vapor slightly more in the more volatile component, so that by the time vapor reaches the top of the column, it is far purer than a single simple distillation could achieve.

**Worked example.** Consider crude oil refining, the industrial application most students encounter first. Crude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons with boiling points ranging from below 20°C (light gases) to over 400°C (heavy residues like asphalt). The oil is heated to roughly 400°C in a furnace and fed into a tall fractionating tower. As vapors rise, the temperature inside the tower decreases with height. Hydrocarbons condense at whatever height corresponds to their boiling point: gasoline components (boiling around 40–200°C) condense in the upper-middle sections, kerosene and diesel (200–350°C) lower down, and heavy lubricating oils and residues remain near the bottom. Trays at each level collect the liquid fractions, which are drawn off separately. This single physical principle—vaporization and condensation sorted by temperature gradient—produces the fuels, plastics feedstocks, and lubricants that underlie modern industry.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you are designing a lab-scale distillation to separate ethanol (boiling point 78°C) from water (boiling point 100°C) to produce a higher-purity ethanol solution. A simple distillation (one vaporization-condensation cycle) yields only modest enrichment because ethanol and water form a mixture whose vapor is not overwhelmingly ethanol-rich near their boiling points. The engineering fix is to add a fractionating column: each theoretical "plate" in the column approximates one additional vaporization-condensation cycle, progressively increasing vapor purity. If you need higher-purity ethanol, you increase the number of theoretical plates (a taller or more efficient column) rather than simply reheating the mixture—illustrating that separation efficiency in fractional distillation is governed by the number of equilibrium stages, not by temperature alone.

## Payoff

Fractional distillation solves a problem that simpler techniques cannot: separating a mixture of many liquids whose boiling points lie close together, into individually pure components, in a single continuous process. A simple distillation works when boiling points differ by more than about 25°C, because one vaporization-condensation cycle is enough to enrich the vapor in the more volatile component. But crude oil, fermented broth, and most real industrial mixtures contain dozens of compounds with overlapping boiling ranges. Fractional distillation solves this by repeating the vaporization-condensation cycle many times within a single fractionating column, where each theoretical plate acts like one simple distillation stacked on the next. The result is a cascade of separations happening simultaneously, sorting a complex mixture into cuts of increasing boiling point — the natural endpoint of everything this book has built toward, because it is where phase equilibrium, vapor pressure, and separation efficiency converge into one working system.

This is why fractional distillation is the capstone: it is not a new idea so much as the payoff of every earlier one, scaled up and made practical.

Consider how it reaches into each domain this book has prepared you for. In **petroleum refining**, fractional distillation is the very first unit operation crude oil encounters — a single tower splits it into gases, naphtha, kerosene, diesel, and heavier residues by boiling range, before any chemical transformation begins. In **beverage and biofuel production**, the same column geometry concentrates ethanol from a dilute fermentation broth up toward its azeotropic limit, turning a low-value liquid into a marketable product. In **industrial and specialty chemical manufacturing**, it purifies solvents and intermediates to the tight specifications that downstream reactions demand, since even trace impurities can ruin a synthesis. And in **laboratory and pharmaceutical purification**, smaller-scale fractionating columns isolate a target compound from close-boiling byproducts when recrystallization or simple distillation cannot achieve the needed purity.

Notice the pattern: the same physical principle — repeated equilibration between liquid and vapor — solves problems at every scale, from a benchtop flask to a distillation tower hundreds of feet tall.

Pick one of these domains and trace it further. A good next question: how does a real refinery's distillation tower decide how many trays it needs, and what happens when the crude oil feedstock changes?

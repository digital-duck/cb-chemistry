## Matter

**Matter** is anything that has mass and occupies space. From the air you breathe to the screen you're reading, all physical substances are matter. Understanding matter means understanding how it is classified, how it behaves, and how its properties can be measured and predicted.

Matter exists in distinct **phases** — solid, liquid, gas, and plasma — each defined by how its particles are arranged and how freely they move. In a solid, particles are locked in fixed positions and vibrate in place. In a liquid, they remain close but slide past one another. In a gas, particles move rapidly and spread to fill any container. Plasma, the fourth phase, consists of ionized gas and is the most abundant form of matter in the universe, found in stars and lightning bolts.

Chemists classify matter further by composition. A **pure substance** has a fixed, uniform composition — either a single element (like oxygen, O₂) or a compound (like water, H₂O) with atoms bonded in a definite ratio. Everything else is a **mixture**: two or more substances combined physically, not chemically, so the components retain their individual properties and can be separated by physical means such as filtration or distillation.

**Worked example.** Saltwater is a mixture — the salt dissolves uniformly throughout the water, but no chemical bonds form between them. To recover pure water, you boil the solution: water evaporates, salt stays behind, and condensing the steam gives you distilled water. The salt was never chemically changed; it dissolves and re-crystallizes intact.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a lab sample is described as "a silvery solid that melts at 29.8 °C, conducts electricity, and cannot be broken into simpler substances by chemical means." Each clue maps to a classification: melts near room temperature → physical property; conducts electricity → metallic behavior; cannot be broken down chemically → element, not compound. The substance is gallium (Ga). Applying the matter classification framework — phase, then pure substance vs. mixture, then element vs. compound — lets you identify unknowns from observable evidence without guesswork.

This framework underlies nearly every branch of science and engineering, from designing alloys to purifying pharmaceuticals.

## Measurement

Measurement is the process of assigning a numerical value to a physical quantity by comparing it against a defined standard unit. Every measurement has three components: a numerical magnitude, a unit, and an uncertainty. Without all three, a measurement is incomplete — saying a rod is "5" tells you nothing; saying it is $5.0 \pm 0.1 \text{ cm}$ is a scientific statement.

The foundation of modern measurement is the International System of Units (SI), which defines seven base units — meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela — from which all other units are derived. Precision describes how reproducible a measurement is; accuracy describes how close it is to the true value. A bathroom scale that always reads 2 kg too heavy is precise but not accurate. Calibration is the process of correcting systematic offsets like this.

**Worked example.** A student measures the period of a pendulum five times and records: $1.82, 1.79, 1.81, 1.80, 1.83$ seconds. The mean is

$$\bar{T} = \frac{1.82 + 1.79 + 1.81 + 1.80 + 1.83}{5} = 1.81 \text{ s}$$

The standard deviation of the sample is approximately $0.015$ s, so the result is reported as $T = 1.81 \pm 0.02 \text{ s}$ (rounding the uncertainty to one significant figure). Note that the final answer's last digit matches the uncertainty's digit — a key convention in scientific reporting.

**Applying measurement to solve problems.** When combining measurements, uncertainties propagate. If you compute speed as $v = d/t$ where $d = 10.0 \pm 0.1 \text{ m}$ and $t = 2.00 \pm 0.02 \text{ s}$, the relative uncertainties add:

$$\frac{\delta v}{v} = \frac{\delta d}{d} + \frac{\delta t}{t} = \frac{0.1}{10.0} + \frac{0.02}{2.00} = 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.02$$

So $v = 5.00 \text{ m/s}$ with a $2\%$ uncertainty, reported as $5.00 \pm 0.10 \text{ m/s}$.

This propagation logic appears everywhere: in pharmaceutical dosing, sensor fusion in robotics, and financial risk models. Mastering it means you can not only take a measurement but honestly state what it does — and does not — tell you.

## Physical Property

A **physical property** is any characteristic of a substance that can be observed or measured without changing the substance's chemical identity. When you measure the boiling point of water or weigh a block of iron, the water is still water and the iron is still iron afterward — that's the hallmark of a physical property.

Physical properties fall into two categories. **Intensive properties** are independent of sample size: density, melting point, and electrical conductivity stay the same whether you have 1 gram or 1 kilogram of a substance. **Extensive properties** scale with sample size: mass, volume, and length all increase as you add more material. This distinction matters enormously in identification work — intensive properties serve as fingerprints for unknown substances, while extensive properties do not.

**Worked Example**

A lab receives an unknown silvery metal. Measurements give a mass of 54.0 g and a volume of 20.0 cm³. Is this aluminum (density 2.70 g/cm³) or titanium (density 4.51 g/cm³)?

Calculate density:

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{54.0 \text{ g}}{20.0 \text{ cm}^3} = 2.70 \text{ g/cm}^3$$

This matches aluminum. Notice that you never dissolved or reacted the metal — you exploited a physical property (density) to identify it. The metal remains chemically unchanged.

**Problem-Solving Application**

Physical properties are the first diagnostic toolkit in any materials or forensic context. When identifying an unknown sample, the strategy is:

1. Measure intensive physical properties (density, melting point, refractive index, hardness).
2. Compare against a reference database.
3. Narrow candidates until a unique match emerges.

Consider a forensic analyst testing a white powder. Measuring its melting point at 801 °C immediately rules out most organic compounds and points toward an ionic salt — no chemical reaction required.

A common student mistake is confusing physical properties with chemical properties. Flammability, reactivity with acid, and tendency to rust are **chemical properties** — observing them requires a chemical change that produces a new substance. If the measurement leaves the substance intact, it's physical; if it transforms the substance, it's chemical. Keep that boundary clear and you'll categorize correctly every time.

## SI Units

The International System of Units (SI) is the globally agreed-upon framework for measurement. It defines seven base units — meter (m), kilogram (kg), second (s), ampere (A), kelvin (K), mole (mol), and candela (cd) — from which every other physical quantity is derived. SI units exist so that a temperature reading in Tokyo means exactly the same thing to a physicist in São Paulo. Without this shared language, scientific collaboration and engineering across borders would be impossible.

Every derived unit is a product of base units raised to integer powers. Speed, for example, is distance divided by time: $\text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$. The unit itself encodes the definition. This is the first tool for catching errors: every term on both sides of a valid equation must have identical units. If they don't match, the equation is wrong — no exceptions.

**Worked example.** A car travels 150 km in 1.5 hours. What is its average speed in SI base units?

$$v = \frac{d}{t} = \frac{150{,}000\ \text{m}}{5{,}400\ \text{s}} \approx 27.8\ \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$$

Notice the conversion: $150\ \text{km} = 150 \times 10^3\ \text{m}$ and $1.5\ \text{h} = 1.5 \times 3600\ \text{s}$. The unit arithmetic — meters divided by seconds — confirms the answer is a speed.

**Problem-solving application.** Unit checking also reveals hidden errors. Suppose a formula for kinetic energy is proposed as $E = \frac{1}{2} m v$. Check the units:

$$[m][v] = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$$

That is not energy — it is momentum. The correct formula $E = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$ gives:

$$\text{kg} \cdot (\text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1})^2 = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$$

The mistake is caught before a single number is plugged in. This habit — tracking units through every algebraic step — is one of the most reliable error-checking strategies in quantitative work, and it only works because SI gives every quantity an unambiguous, universally shared unit.

## Intensive Property

An **intensive property** is a physical or chemical property of a substance that does not depend on the amount of material present. No matter how large or small a sample you take, an intensive property remains the same. Temperature, pressure, density, boiling point, and concentration are all intensive properties. Contrast this with an **extensive** property — like mass or volume — which scales with the size of the sample. One section, one new idea: this section focuses on intensive properties; extensive properties are simply the contrast class needed to make the definition precise.

The practical significance is immediate: intensive properties are what you use to *identify* a substance. If you pull a 1 g chip and a 100 g block from the same piece of pure copper, both will have the same density ($8.96\ \text{g/cm}^3$) and the same melting point ($1085\ ^\circ\text{C}$). The amount doesn't matter.

**Worked example.** You have a 500 mL saline solution containing 4.5 g of NaCl. You pour out exactly 100 mL.

- Mass of NaCl in 100 mL portion: $4.5\ \text{g} \times \dfrac{100}{500} = 0.90\ \text{g}$
- Volume of 100 mL portion: $100\ \text{mL}$

Both mass and volume are *extensive* — they changed when you split the sample. Now compute the concentration of the original and the poured-out portion:

$$c = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{4.5\ \text{g}}{500\ \text{mL}} = \frac{0.90\ \text{g}}{100\ \text{mL}} = 9.0\ \text{g/L}$$

The concentration is identical in both portions — it is intensive.

**Problem-solving application.** In the lab you measure the density of an unknown liquid as $0.789\ \text{g/mL}$. A reference table lists ethanol at $0.789\ \text{g/mL}$ and isopropanol at $0.786\ \text{g/mL}$ at $25\ ^\circ\text{C}$. Because density is intensive, your measurement is a *substance fingerprint*: the sample is consistent with ethanol regardless of whether you tested 5 mL or 500 mL. You do not need to know how much liquid is in the bottle — only what it is. The identification is complete as soon as the intensive property matches.

Recognizing which properties are intensive is the first filter in any quantitative analysis: intensive properties travel with the substance; extensive properties travel with the sample.

## Dimensional Analysis

Every physical quantity carries two parts: a number and a unit. Dimensional analysis is the practice of tracking units through calculations the same way you track variables in algebra — so that the units in your answer confirm whether the calculation was set up correctly. If you compute a speed and the units simplify to meters per second, you have strong evidence the algebra is right. If they simplify to meters squared, something went wrong before you even check the arithmetic.

The core technique is unit cancellation. Write every conversion factor as a fraction equal to 1, then multiply so that unwanted units cancel and desired units remain.

**Worked example.** A car travels at 60 miles per hour. Convert this speed to meters per second.

$$60 \frac{\text{mi}}{\text{hr}} \times \frac{1609\,\text{m}}{1\,\text{mi}} \times \frac{1\,\text{hr}}{3600\,\text{s}} = \frac{60 \times 1609}{3600} \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \approx 26.8\,\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$$

Notice that `mi` appears in the numerator of the first factor and the denominator of the second, so it cancels. `hr` cancels the same way. Only `m/s` survives — exactly the unit we wanted.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a pump moves water at $2.5\,\text{L/min}$ and you need to fill a $400\,\text{L}$ tank. How many hours will it take?

$$400\,\text{L} \times \frac{1\,\text{min}}{2.5\,\text{L}} \times \frac{1\,\text{hr}}{60\,\text{min}} = \frac{400}{2.5 \times 60}\,\text{hr} \approx 2.67\,\text{hr}$$

The unit chain tells the story: liters cancel, minutes cancel, and hours remain. No memorized formula required — the units guided every step.

This same principle scales to complex engineering and science problems. Pharmacists use it to compute dosing rates (mg/kg/day → mL/hr for an IV drip). Physicists use it to check whether a proposed equation is even dimensionally consistent before solving it. In code, libraries like Python's `pint` enforce dimensional analysis automatically, raising an error if you accidentally add meters to seconds. The deeper lesson: units are not bookkeeping noise — they are constraints that rule out entire classes of errors before any calculation begins.

## Temperature

**Temperature** is a scalar quantity that measures the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. More precisely, it characterizes the direction of spontaneous heat flow: energy moves from a region of higher temperature to one of lower temperature until thermal equilibrium is reached. In the SI system, temperature is measured in kelvin (K), though Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) are common in everyday use. The conversions are:

$$T_K = T_C + 273.15 \qquad T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32$$

Absolute zero (0 K, −273.15 °C) is the theoretical lower bound, where particle motion is minimal.

**Worked example.** A recipe requires an oven at 375 °F. Your oven dial shows Celsius. What temperature should you set?

Starting from $T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32$, solve for $T_C$:

$$T_C = \frac{5}{9}(T_F - 32) = \frac{5}{9}(375 - 32) = \frac{5}{9}(343) \approx 190.6 \,°C$$

Set the oven to about 191 °C. Notice the asymmetry: a 1 °F change corresponds to only a 5/9 °C change, so Fahrenheit gives finer apparent granularity at the cost of less intuitive scale.

**Problem-solving application.** Temperature shows up wherever energy transfer matters — thermodynamics, chemistry, meteorology, and materials science. In Python, analyzing a time-series of temperature readings is a typical data task:

```python
import statistics

readings_C = [18.2, 19.5, 22.1, 25.3, 23.8, 20.0]

mean_C = statistics.mean(readings_C)
mean_K  = mean_C + 273.15

print(f"Mean: {mean_C:.2f} °C  ({mean_K:.2f} K)")
print(f"Std dev: {statistics.stdev(readings_C):.2f} °C")
```

Running this identifies both the average thermal state and the variability — relevant for, say, detecting an overheating server rack or monitoring a patient's fever trend.

Key distinctions to keep in mind: **temperature** is an intensive property (it does not depend on the amount of material), while **heat** is energy in transit. A large pot of water at 50 °C contains far more thermal energy than a drop at the same temperature, yet their temperatures are identical. Confusing the two is one of the most common errors in introductory thermodynamics.

## Temperature Scale Conversion

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. Three scales are in common use: **Celsius** (°C), used in most of the world and in science; **Fahrenheit** (°F), used in everyday life in the United States; and **Kelvin** (K), the SI base unit used in thermodynamics and physics. Converting between them is a fundamental skill in any quantitative science course.

The conversion formulas follow directly from how each scale is defined. Celsius and Fahrenheit are offset linear scales — they share the same physical zero (absolute zero) but disagree on where to place the freezing and boiling points of water. Kelvin is simply Celsius shifted so that 0 K corresponds to absolute zero (−273.15 °C), eliminating negative temperatures for most physical calculations.

The three core conversions are:

$$F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$$

$$C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)$$

$$K = C + 273.15$$

**Worked example.** A patient's body temperature reads 101.3 °F. Convert to Celsius and Kelvin.

Step 1 — Fahrenheit to Celsius:
$$C = \frac{5}{9}(101.3 - 32) = \frac{5}{9}(69.3) \approx 38.5 \, ^\circ\text{C}$$

Step 2 — Celsius to Kelvin:
$$K = 38.5 + 273.15 = 311.65 \, \text{K}$$

So a mild fever of 101.3 °F equals approximately 38.5 °C or 311.65 K.

**Problem-solving application.** Scale conversion errors cause real failures — a NASA Mars orbiter was lost in 1999 partly because one engineering team used imperial units while another used metric. When solving problems, always (1) identify the input scale, (2) apply the correct formula, and (3) sanity-check the result against known benchmarks: water freezes at 0 °C / 32 °F / 273.15 K and boils at 100 °C / 212 °F / 373.15 K. If your answer lands outside a physically plausible range, recheck the formula direction — the most common error is subtracting 32 after multiplying by 9/5 rather than before.

```python
def to_celsius(value, from_scale):
    if from_scale == "F":
        return (value - 32) * 5 / 9
    elif from_scale == "K":
        return value - 273.15
    return value  # already Celsius
```

## Payoff

Every measurement system is a choice. Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin each encode a different decision about what counts as zero and how large a degree should be — and none of those choices is universally right. Temperature scale conversion is the skill that lets you move freely between those choices, reading data from any source and reasoning about it in any context without losing accuracy or meaning.

At its core, the conversion between scales is an affine transformation: a linear rescaling combined with a shift in origin. Between Celsius and Fahrenheit, that relationship is

$$T_F = \frac{9}{5}\,T_C + 32$$

and between Celsius and Kelvin,

$$T_K = T_C + 273.15$$

The factor $\frac{9}{5}$ rescales the size of a degree; the additive constants relocate the zero point. These two operations together mean that the functions are invertible and composable — you can chain them in any order and arrive at the same answer. That composability is not a coincidence; it is exactly what makes a system of measurement units coherent.

The practical payoff is immediate. A weather dataset downloaded from a European agency reports temperatures in Celsius; your model was trained on Fahrenheit data from NOAA. Without conversion, every comparison is corrupted — not subtly, but by tens of degrees. A chemistry simulation runs in Kelvin because the ideal gas law $PV = nRT$ requires an absolute temperature scale where $T = 0$ corresponds to zero molecular kinetic energy, not to a historical saltwater-ice experiment. A patient's fever recorded as 38.6 °C needs to read as 101.5 °F on a display built for a North American clinic. In each case, the conversion is not optional bookkeeping — it is the load-bearing step that makes the data usable.

The concept is deceptively simple to state and surprisingly easy to get wrong under pressure: the most common error is applying the multiplicative factor without the additive shift, or applying the shift to the wrong scale. Working through the algebra once, explicitly, cures that habit permanently.

If one application deserves deeper exploration, it is the role of the Kelvin scale in thermodynamics and physical chemistry. The requirement that temperature be absolute — anchored to a physically meaningful zero — shapes the form of every equation from the ideal gas law to the Boltzmann distribution. Start there, and you will find that a unit conversion you learned in minutes opens the door to an entire discipline.

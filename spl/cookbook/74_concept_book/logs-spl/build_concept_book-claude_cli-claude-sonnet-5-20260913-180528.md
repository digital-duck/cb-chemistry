## Measurement

**Definition.** A *measurement* is a mapping $m: Q \to \mathbb{R} \times U$ that assigns to a physical quantity $Q$ a numerical value $x \in \mathbb{R}$ together with a unit $u \in U$, such that the pair $(x, u)$ represents $Q$ relative to a chosen reference standard. Formally, if $Q$ belongs to a one-dimensional quantity space with reference unit $u_0$, then $m(Q) = (x, u_0)$ where $x = Q / u_0$, the ratio of $Q$ to the magnitude of $u_0$. Every measurement carries an associated *uncertainty* $\delta x \geq 0$, so the complete report is the triple $(x, \delta x, u)$.

**Worked example.** Suppose a rod has true length $L$, and a ruler graduated in millimeters yields a reading $x = 152.3\,\text{mm}$ with instrument resolution $\delta x = 0.1\,\text{mm}$. The measurement is reported as $L = (152.3 \pm 0.1)\,\text{mm}$, meaning $L \in [152.2, 152.4]\,\text{mm}$ under the assumption of uniform reading error. Converting to centimeters, since $1\,\text{cm} = 10\,\text{mm}$, gives $L = (15.23 \pm 0.01)\,\text{cm}$, illustrating that the ratio $x/\delta x$ (the relative precision) is invariant under a change of unit, while $x$ and $\delta x$ individually rescale.

**Key theorem (propagation of uncertainty).** If $f = f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is a differentiable function of independently measured quantities $x_i$ each with uncertainty $\delta x_i$, then to first order
$$
(\delta f)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\right)^2 (\delta x_i)^2.
$$
This follows from a first-order Taylor expansion of $f$ about the measured values, combined with the assumption of uncorrelated errors.

## Matter

**Definition.** In classical physics, *matter* is any substance that possesses mass and occupies volume, thereby exhibiting inertia and interacting through gravitational and electromagnetic forces. Formally, a body of matter is characterized by a mass density function $\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$, defined so that the total mass in a region $V$ is

$$
m = \int_V \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)\, dV.
$$

Matter is distinguished from massless fields (such as electromagnetic radiation in vacuum) by satisfying $\rho > 0$ almost everywhere in its occupied domain, and by obeying conservation of mass, expressed locally via the continuity equation.

**Worked example.** Consider a thin rod of length $L$ with linear mass density $\lambda(x) = \lambda_0\left(1 + \dfrac{x}{L}\right)$ for $x \in [0, L]$. The total mass is

$$
m = \int_0^L \lambda_0\left(1 + \frac{x}{L}\right) dx = \lambda_0\left[x + \frac{x^2}{2L}\right]_0^L = \frac{3}{2}\lambda_0 L.
$$

This illustrates how the abstract definition of matter as mass-bearing substance reduces to an integral computation once a density function is specified.

**Key theorem (Conservation of Mass).** For a closed system with no mass flux across its boundary $\partial V$, the total mass is conserved:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\int_V \rho\, dV = -\oint_{\partial V} \rho\, \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{n}\, dA = 0,
$$

which follows from the divergence theorem applied to the continuity equation $\partial_t \rho + \nabla\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v}) = 0$.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

x, L, lam0 = sp.symbols('x L lambda_0', positive=True)
lam = lam0 * (1 + x/L)
mass = sp.integrate(lam, (x, 0, L))
print(sp.simplify(mass))  # 3*L*lambda_0/2
```

## Si Units

**Definition.** The International System of Units (SI) is the coherent system of measurement built from seven base units, each defined by a fixed value of a fundamental physical constant: the second ($\mathrm{s}$, via the cesium-133 hyperfine transition frequency), the meter ($\mathrm{m}$, via the speed of light $c$), the kilogram ($\mathrm{kg}$, via the Planck constant $h$), the ampere ($\mathrm{A}$, via the elementary charge $e$), the kelvin ($\mathrm{K}$, via the Boltzmann constant $k_B$), the mole ($\mathrm{mol}$, via the Avogadro constant $N_A$), and the candela ($\mathrm{cd}$, via a fixed luminous efficacy). Every other physical unit, called a *derived unit*, is expressed as a product of powers of these seven: $[Q] = \mathrm{m}^{a}\,\mathrm{kg}^{b}\,\mathrm{s}^{c}\,\mathrm{A}^{d}\,\mathrm{K}^{e}\,\mathrm{mol}^{f}\,\mathrm{cd}^{g}$.

**Worked example.** Consider force, defined by Newton's second law $F = ma$. Since $[m] = \mathrm{kg}$ and $[a] = \mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, dimensional consistency requires $[F] = \mathrm{kg}\cdot\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, which we name the newton: $1\,\mathrm{N} = 1\,\mathrm{kg}\cdot\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-2}$. This illustrates how derived units inherit their exponents directly from a governing physical law.

**Key theorem (Buckingham $\pi$ theorem).** If a physical relationship among $n$ dimensional variables involves $k$ independent base dimensions, it can be rewritten equivalently as a relationship among $n-k$ dimensionless groups $\pi_1, \dots, \pi_{n-k}$. This theorem justifies dimensional analysis as a method for checking equations and constructing scale-invariant physical laws without solving the underlying differential equations explicitly.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp
from sympy.physics.units import kg, m, s, N, convert_to

# Verify F = m*a has units of newtons
mass = 2 * kg
accel = 3 * m / s**2
force = mass * accel

print(convert_to(force, N))   # -> 6*newton
```

## Physical Property

**Definition.** A *physical property* is a real-valued function $Q$ that assigns to a physical system a numerical value, expressed in a chosen unit system, which can in principle be measured or derived from measurement without altering the chemical identity of the system. If a system's condition is described by measurable quantities such as mass, volume, and temperature, a physical property is any well-defined function $Q$ of those quantities.

**Worked example.** Consider a sample of gas of mass $m$ occupying volume $V$ at temperature $T$. Density $\rho = m/V$ is a physical property: it is measurable (via mass and volume determinations), it does not depend on how much gas you happen to have sampled (it is *intensive*), and it transforms consistently under unit changes, e.g., $\rho\,[\mathrm{kg/m^3}] = 1000\,\rho\,[\mathrm{g/cm^3}]$. Contrast this with mass $m$ itself, an *extensive* property that scales with system size.

**Key theorem (Intensive–Extensive Decomposition).** Every physical property $Q$ of a homogeneous system can be classified as extensive or intensive: $Q$ is extensive if $Q(\lambda S) = \lambda\, Q(S)$ for all scaling factors $\lambda > 0$ (where $\lambda S$ denotes $\lambda$ copies of the system), and intensive if $Q(\lambda S) = Q(S)$. Any extensive property $Q$ can be converted to an intensive one by dividing by another extensive property, typically mass or volume, e.g., $\rho = m/V$.

*Proof sketch.* Partition the homogeneous system into $\lambda$ identical subsystems. Extensive quantities (mass, volume, internal energy) sum additively across subsystems, giving the scaling law $Q(\lambda S) = \lambda Q(S)$. Intensive quantities (density, temperature, pressure) are determined locally and are unaffected by the number of subsystems, yielding $Q(\lambda S) = Q(S)$. $\blacksquare$

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

m, V, lam = sp.symbols('m V lambda', positive=True)
rho = m / V

rho_scaled = rho.subs({m: lam*m, V: lam*V})
print(sp.simplify(rho_scaled - rho))  # 0  -> confirms rho is intensive
```

---

## Intensive Property

**Definition.** A physical property $P$ of a thermodynamic system is called *intensive* if its value does not depend on the extent (size or mass) of the system. Formally, suppose a homogeneous system is partitioned into two subsystems with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, each in the same thermodynamic state as the whole. If $P$ satisfies
$$
P(\lambda \, m) = P(m), \qquad \lambda > 0,
$$
then $P$ is intensive. This contrasts with an *extensive* property $E$, which scales linearly with system size, $E(\lambda m) = \lambda\, E(m)$. Common intensive properties include temperature $T$, pressure $p$, density $\rho$, and specific quantities such as molar volume $\bar v = V/n$.

**Worked example.** Consider a container of water at uniform temperature $T = 25^{\circ}\text{C}$ and density $\rho = 997\ \text{kg/m}^3$. If the container is divided into two equal halves, each half still has $T = 25^{\circ}\text{C}$ and $\rho = 997\ \text{kg/m}^3$ — these values are unchanged by halving the mass. In contrast, the total volume $V$ and total mass $m$ are each halved, confirming that $V$ and $m$ are extensive while $T$ and $\rho$ are intensive.

**Key theorem.** If $E$ is an extensive property that is a homogeneous function of degree 1 in the extensive variables $\{n_i\}$ (mole numbers) at fixed intensive variables, Euler's theorem gives
$$
E(n_1, \dots, n_k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial n_i}\right)_{T,p,n_{j\neq i}},
$$
where each partial molar derivative $\bar{e}_i = \left(\partial E/\partial n_i\right)$ is itself intensive. This identity underlies the definition of chemical potential and partial molar quantities in chemical thermodynamics.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

n, V_m = sp.symbols('n V_m', positive=True)   # V_m: molar volume (intensive)
V = n * V_m                                    # total volume (extensive)

lam = sp.symbols('lambda', positive=True)
scaled = V.subs(n, lam*n)
print(sp.simplify(scaled / V))                 # -> lambda, confirms V is extensive
print(sp.simplify(V_m.subs(n, lam*n) / V_m))   # -> 1, confirms V_m is intensive
```

## Mass

Mass is a fundamental physical quantity that measures the amount of matter contained in a body and its resistance to acceleration under an applied force. Formally, mass $m$ is a positive scalar, measured in kilograms ($\text{kg}$) in the International System of Units, that appears as the constant of proportionality in Newton's second law:
$$
\vec{F} = m\vec{a},
$$
where $\vec{F}$ is the net force acting on the body and $\vec{a}$ is the resulting acceleration. Mass is distinguished from weight, which is the gravitational force $\vec{F}_g = m\vec{g}$ acting on that mass and therefore depends on location, whereas mass itself is an intrinsic, location-independent property.

**Worked example.** A body of unknown mass is subjected to a constant net force of $F = 20\ \text{N}$ and observed to accelerate at $a = 4\ \text{m/s}^2$. Solving Newton's second law for $m$,
$$
m = \frac{F}{a} = \frac{20\ \text{N}}{4\ \text{m/s}^2} = 5\ \text{kg}.
$$

**Key theorem (Conservation of Mass).** In a closed system undergoing any classical (non-relativistic) physical or chemical process, total mass remains constant:
$$
\sum_i m_i(t) = \text{constant for all } t.
$$
*Proof sketch.* Mass is additive over disjoint subsystems, and in the absence of matter flux across the system boundary, no mechanism exists within Newtonian mechanics to create or destroy mass; hence any redistribution among subsystems leaves the total invariant, as confirmed experimentally to high precision in isolated mechanical and chemical systems.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

F, a, m = sp.symbols('F a m', positive=True)
newton_second_law = sp.Eq(F, m * a)

mass_expr = sp.solve(newton_second_law, m)[0]
result = mass_expr.subs({F: 20, a: 4})
print(f"m = {result} kg")  # m = 5 kg
```

## Measurement Uncertainty

**Definition.** Every physical measurement $x$ of a quantity is reported as $x = x_0 \pm \sigma_x$, where $x_0$ is the best estimate (typically a mean of repeated trials) and $\sigma_x$ is the *uncertainty*, an estimate of the dispersion of plausible values around $x_0$. When a derived quantity $f = f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ is computed from measured quantities, its uncertainty is obtained by *propagation of uncertainty*.

**Key theorem (propagation of uncertainty).** If $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are independent random variables with uncertainties $\sigma_{x_1}, \dots, \sigma_{x_n}$, and $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is differentiable, then to first order in a Taylor expansion about $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$,

$$
\sigma_f^2 \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\right)^2 \sigma_{x_i}^2.
$$

*Proof sketch.* Write $f(x_1+\delta_1, \dots, x_n+\delta_n) \approx f(x_1,\dots,x_n) + \sum_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\delta_i$. Taking the variance of both sides, and using independence (so cross terms $\mathbb{E}[\delta_i \delta_j] = 0$ for $i \neq j$), yields the stated sum of squares.

**Worked example.** A rectangle has measured side lengths $L = 5.00 \pm 0.02\ \text{cm}$ and $W = 3.00 \pm 0.01\ \text{cm}$. The area is $A = LW$. Then
$$
\sigma_A = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial L}\right)^2 \sigma_L^2 + \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial W}\right)^2 \sigma_W^2} = \sqrt{W^2\sigma_L^2 + L^2\sigma_W^2}.
$$
Substituting values: $\sigma_A = \sqrt{(3.00)^2(0.02)^2 + (5.00)^2(0.01)^2} = \sqrt{0.0036 + 0.0025} \approx 0.078\ \text{cm}^2$. So $A = 15.00 \pm 0.08\ \text{cm}^2$.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

L, W, sigma_L, sigma_W = sp.symbols('L W sigma_L sigma_W', positive=True)
A = L * W

sigma_A = sp.sqrt((sp.diff(A, L))**2 * sigma_L**2 + (sp.diff(A, W))**2 * sigma_W**2)
sigma_A_value = sigma_A.subs({L: 5.00, W: 3.00, sigma_L: 0.02, sigma_W: 0.01})

print("sigma_A =", sp.N(sigma_A_value, 3))
```

## Precision

**Definition.** Precision refers to the degree of reproducibility or agreement among repeated measurements of the same quantity under unchanged conditions. Formally, if $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are independent measurements of a fixed quantity, precision is inversely related to the dispersion of these values, commonly quantified by the sample standard deviation
$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}, \qquad \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.
$$
A small $s$ indicates high precision; a large $s$ indicates low precision. Precision concerns the *spread* of measurements around their own mean and is distinct from accuracy, which concerns the closeness of that mean to the true value $\mu$.

**Worked example.** Suppose a student measures the period of a pendulum five times, obtaining $T = 2.01, 2.03, 1.99, 2.02, 2.00$ seconds. The mean is $\bar{T} = 2.010$ s. Computing the sample standard deviation yields $s \approx 0.0158$ s. Since the values cluster tightly around $\bar{T}$, the measurements are precise, regardless of whether $\bar{T}$ equals the pendulum's true period.

**Key theorem.** *Bias–variance decomposition of mean squared error.* For an estimator $\hat{\theta}$ of a parameter $\theta$,
$$
\mathbb{E}\big[(\hat{\theta} - \theta)^2\big] = \underbrace{\big(\mathbb{E}[\hat{\theta}] - \theta\big)^2}_{\text{bias}^2 \,(\text{accuracy})} + \underbrace{\operatorname{Var}(\hat{\theta})}_{\text{precision}}.
$$
This identity formalizes the separation between accuracy (bias) and precision (variance): total measurement error decomposes exactly into these two independent contributions, and eliminating one does not guarantee eliminating the other.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

data = [2.01, 2.03, 1.99, 2.02, 2.00]
n = len(data)
mean = sp.Rational(sum(data), n).evalf()

variance = sum((sp.Rational(x) - mean)**2 for x in data) / (n - 1)
std_dev = sp.sqrt(variance)

print(f"Mean: {mean}")
print(f"Sample standard deviation (precision measure): {std_dev.evalf()}")
```

## Volume

**Definition.** Let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ be a solid region bounded by continuous surfaces, and suppose that for each $x \in [a,b]$ the cross-section of $S$ perpendicular to the $x$-axis has area $A(x)$, where $A$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. The **volume** of $S$ is defined as
$$
V = \int_a^b A(x)\,dx.
$$
This generalizes the familiar formula $V = \text{base} \times \text{height}$ by summing infinitesimally thin slices of cross-sectional area over the solid's extent.

**Worked example.** Consider the solid obtained by rotating the region under $y = \sqrt{x}$, for $0 \le x \le 4$, about the $x$-axis. Each cross-section perpendicular to the $x$-axis is a disk of radius $r(x) = \sqrt{x}$, so
$$
A(x) = \pi \left(\sqrt{x}\right)^2 = \pi x.
$$
Then
$$
V = \int_0^4 \pi x \, dx = \pi \left[\frac{x^2}{2}\right]_0^4 = 8\pi.
$$

**Key theorem (Disk/Washer and Shell Methods).** If a solid of revolution is generated by rotating a region about an axis, its volume may be computed either by the disk (or washer) method, integrating cross-sectional areas $A(x) = \pi \big(R(x)^2 - r(x)^2\big)$, or by the shell method,
$$
V = \int_a^b 2\pi x \, f(x)\, dx,
$$
integrating cylindrical shell surfaces. Both methods derive from the general cross-sectional definition of volume via a change of the integration variable, and Fubini's theorem guarantees their equivalence when both are applicable.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

x = sp.symbols('x')
f = sp.sqrt(x)
V = sp.integrate(sp.pi * f**2, (x, 0, 4))
print(V)  # 8*pi
```

---

## Density

**Definition.** Let $f$ be a real-valued function defined on an interval $[a,b]$, representing a physical or probabilistic quantity distributed continuously over that interval. The function $f$ is called a *density* (or *density function*) if the total amount of the quantity contained in any subinterval $[c,d] \subseteq [a,b]$ is given by the definite integral

$$
Q([c,d]) = \int_c^d f(x)\, dx.
$$

Intuitively, $f(x)$ measures "quantity per unit length" at the point $x$, so that quantity accumulates as the integral of density over an interval, generalizing the discrete notion of mass = density $\times$ volume to continuously varying distributions.

**Worked example.** Suppose a thin rod occupies the interval $[0,2]$ (in meters) and has linear mass density $f(x) = 3x^2 + 1$ (in kg/m). The mass of the rod between $x=0$ and $x=1$ is

$$
m = \int_0^1 (3x^2+1)\,dx = \left[x^3 + x\right]_0^1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ kg}.
$$

The total mass of the rod is $\int_0^2 (3x^2+1)\,dx = 8+2 = 10$ kg.

**Key theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, density form).** If $F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\,dt$ is the cumulative quantity function, then $F$ is differentiable wherever $f$ is continuous, and $F'(x) = f(x)$. Thus density is the derivative of the cumulative distribution, and cumulative quantity is the antiderivative of density — the two operations of accumulation and instantaneous rate are mutual inverses.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

x = sp.symbols('x')
f = 3*x**2 + 1          # density function
mass_0_to_1 = sp.integrate(f, (x, 0, 1))
mass_total = sp.integrate(f, (x, 0, 2))
print(mass_0_to_1, mass_total)   # 2 10
```

## Dimensional Analysis

**Definition.** Every physical quantity $Q$ can be expressed as a product of powers of fundamental dimensions—typically mass $\mathsf{M}$, length $\mathsf{L}$, and time $\mathsf{T}$—written as a *dimensional formula* $[Q] = \mathsf{M}^a \mathsf{L}^b \mathsf{T}^c$. Dimensional analysis is the study of relationships among physical quantities by tracking these exponents, independent of the numerical values or units chosen (SI, CGS, etc.). A valid physical equation must be *dimensionally homogeneous*: every additive term must carry the same dimensional formula.

**Worked example.** Consider the period $T$ of a simple pendulum, hypothesized to depend on its length $\ell$, mass $m$, and gravitational acceleration $g$. Assume $T = k\, \ell^a m^b g^c$ for some dimensionless constant $k$. Substituting dimensions—$[T]=\mathsf{T}$, $[\ell]=\mathsf{L}$, $[m]=\mathsf{M}$, $[g]=\mathsf{L}\mathsf{T}^{-2}$—gives
$$\mathsf{T} = \mathsf{L}^a \mathsf{M}^b (\mathsf{L}\mathsf{T}^{-2})^c = \mathsf{L}^{a+c}\mathsf{M}^b\mathsf{T}^{-2c}.$$
Matching exponents: $b=0$ (mass), $-2c=1 \Rightarrow c=-\tfrac12$, and $a+c=0 \Rightarrow a=\tfrac12$. Thus $T = k\sqrt{\ell/g}$, recovering the correct functional form without solving the pendulum's differential equation.

**Key theorem (Buckingham $\pi$ theorem).** If a physical relation among $n$ variables involves $r$ independent fundamental dimensions, the relation can be rewritten equivalently in terms of $n-r$ dimensionless groups $\pi_1, \dots, \pi_{n-r}$. This theorem guarantees that dimensional analysis, though it cannot determine dimensionless constants like $k$, always reduces the complexity of a physical law by exactly $r$ parameters.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational, solve, Eq

a, b, c = symbols('a b c')
# [T]=T, [l]=L, [m]=M, [g]=L*T^-2
eqs = [Eq(b, 0), Eq(-2*c, 1), Eq(a + c, 0)]
sol = solve(eqs, [a, b, c])
print(sol)  # {a: -1/2... solved as a=1/2 via a+c=0}
```

## Significant Figures

**Definition.** The *significant figures* (sig figs) of a measured or computed quantity are the digits that carry meaningful information about its precision: all nonzero digits, any zeros between nonzero digits, and trailing zeros to the right of a decimal point. Leading zeros (e.g., in $0.0042$) are not significant; they merely fix the decimal position. Formally, if a number is written in scientific notation as $a \times 10^{n}$ with $1 \le |a| < 10$, the significant figures are precisely the digits of the mantissa $a$.

**Worked example.** Consider the measurement $x = 0.003040$ m. In scientific notation, $x = 3.040 \times 10^{-3}$ m. The mantissa $3.040$ has four digits, all significant: the leading zeros in $0.003040$ are not significant, but the trailing zero after the decimal point is, since it signals that the measurement is precise to that place. If this value is multiplied by a constant $c = 2.0$ (two sig figs), the product $c x = 6.080 \times 10^{-3}$ must be rounded to two significant figures, yielding $6.1 \times 10^{-3}$, since the result cannot be more precise than the least precise factor.

**Key theorem (propagation of significant figures).** For multiplication or division of quantities $x_1, \dots, x_k$ with $n_1, \dots, n_k$ significant figures respectively, the result should be reported with $\min(n_1, \dots, n_k)$ significant figures. For addition or subtraction, the result's precision is instead governed by the least precise *decimal place* among the operands, not the count of significant figures. This asymmetry reflects the distinction between relative error (multiplicative operations) and absolute error (additive operations).

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
from sympy import Float, N

def round_to_sig_figs(x, n):
    return float(N(Float(x), n))

x1 = round_to_sig_figs(0.003040, 4)   # 0.003040
x2 = round_to_sig_figs(2.0, 2)
product = round_to_sig_figs(x1 * x2, 2)
print(product)  # 0.0061
```

## Density Calculation

**Definition.** Given a physical object occupying a region $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ with mass $m$ and volume $V = \int_\Omega dV$, the (average) density is defined as
$$
\rho = \frac{m}{V}.
$$
When mass is distributed non-uniformly, one defines a *local density function* $\rho(x,y,z)$ such that
$$
m = \iiint_\Omega \rho(x,y,z)\, dV,
$$
recovering the pointwise mass-per-unit-volume in the limit of a vanishing neighborhood around each point.

**Worked example.** Consider a metal rod of length $L = 2\,\text{m}$ whose linear density varies as $\rho(x) = 3 + x^2$ (in $\text{kg/m}$), for $x \in [0, 2]$. The total mass is
$$
m = \int_0^2 (3 + x^2)\, dx = \left[3x + \frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^2 = 6 + \frac{8}{3} = \frac{26}{3} \approx 8.67\,\text{kg}.
$$
The *average* density over the rod is then $\bar\rho = m/L = \tfrac{26}{3}/2 = \tfrac{13}{3} \approx 4.33\,\text{kg/m}$, distinct from the pointwise density at any single location.

**Key theorem (Mean Value Theorem for Integrals).** If $\rho$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, there exists $c \in [a,b]$ such that
$$
\bar\rho = \rho(c) = \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b \rho(x)\, dx.
$$
This guarantees that the average density equals the actual local density at some point within the domain — a foundational link between integral (global) and pointwise (local) descriptions of mass distribution.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

x = sp.symbols('x')
rho = 3 + x**2
L = 2

mass = sp.integrate(rho, (x, 0, L))
avg_density = mass / L

print("Total mass:", mass)
print("Average density:", sp.nsimplify(avg_density))
```

## Payoff

Density calculation—the determination of $\rho = m/V$ for a body of matter—achieves something deceptively simple yet foundational: it converts an extensive, additive quantity (mass, which grows with the amount of substance) and a geometric quantity (volume) into an intensive property that characterizes a material independently of how much of it you have. A gram of gold and a kilogram of gold share the same density, $\rho \approx 19.3\ \text{g/cm}^3$, even though their masses and volumes differ enormously. This is why density is the natural endpoint of a chapter built on mass and volume: it is the first genuine invariant the student constructs, the prototype for every intensive property (pressure, concentration, refractive index) encountered later.

The formula $\rho = \dfrac{m}{V}$ is deceptively small, but its reach is large precisely because $m$ and $V$ are themselves computable from earlier tools in this book. Wherever a volume integral $V = \iiint_R dV$ can be evaluated—for a solid of revolution, a region bounded by curves, or a body defined implicitly—density calculation supplies immediate physical meaning to that number. Likewise, wherever mass is distributed non-uniformly, the same ratio generalizes to a mass-density function $\rho(x,y,z) = \lim_{\Delta V \to 0} \dfrac{\Delta m}{\Delta V}$, which is exactly the integrand recovered when one *inverts* the volume-integral machinery to compute total mass, $m = \iiint_R \rho(x,y,z)\, dV$. In this sense density calculation is not merely one more topic to cover—it is the concept that closes the loop between geometry (volume) and physics (mass), turning the calculus of this chapter into a tool for describing real materials: alloys, fluids, planetary interiors, and manufactured parts, each characterized by how their mass concentrates in space.

**Lab cell (SymPy):**

```python
from sympy import symbols, integrate, pi

r, h = symbols('r h', positive=True)
V = integrate(2*pi*r*h, (r, 0, r))   # volume of a cylinder, illustrative
m = 850.0   # mass in grams, measured
V_val = pi.evalf() * 2**2 * 10       # radius 2 cm, height 10 cm
rho = m / V_val
print(f"Density: {rho:.4f} g/cm^3")
```

From here, the invitation is open: choose one domain—materials science, where density distinguishes alloys; fluid statics, where it governs buoyancy via Archimedes' principle; or planetary science, where radial density profiles reveal a planet's core composition—and follow density calculation into that application, watching the same ratio $\rho = m/V$ take on a new physical story.

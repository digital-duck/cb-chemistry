## Intermolecular Forces

**Definition.** Intermolecular forces are the attractions that act *between* molecules, distinct from the covalent or ionic bonds that hold atoms together *within* a molecule. Three main types matter for most chemistry problems. London dispersion forces arise in all molecules from momentary, shifting imbalances in electron distribution, and grow stronger with more electrons and larger, more polarizable surface area. Dipole-dipole forces occur between molecules with a permanent unequal sharing of electrons (a dipole), where the partially positive end of one molecule attracts the partially negative end of another. Hydrogen bonding, the strongest of the three, occurs when a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (N, O, or F) is attracted to a lone pair on a nearby electronegative atom. The strength ordering is generally hydrogen bonding > dipole-dipole > dispersion, though large enough molecules can have dispersion forces that outweigh dipole-dipole forces in smaller ones.

**Worked example.** Compare the boiling points of butane ($\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}$, bp $-1\,^\circ\text{C}$) and diethyl ether ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OC}_2\text{H}_5$, bp $35\,^\circ\text{C}$), two molecules of similar molar mass. Butane is nonpolar, so its molecules interact only through dispersion forces. Diethyl ether has a bent C–O–C arrangement with an oxygen atom that gives it a net dipole, adding dipole-dipole attraction on top of dispersion forces. Because boiling requires overcoming intermolecular attractions, the ether's additional dipole-dipole interaction demands more thermal energy, explaining its higher boiling point despite comparable size.

**Problem-solving application.** When ranking boiling or melting points, work through molecules in this order: first check for O–H or N–H bonds (hydrogen bonding present); if absent, check for a permanent dipole from unequal electronegativity and asymmetric shape (dipole-dipole present); if the molecule is symmetric and nonpolar, only dispersion forces apply, and size/surface area become the deciding factor. For example, predict which boils higher: methanol ($\text{CH}_3\text{OH}$) or ethane ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_6$), both with similar molar mass. Methanol has an O–H bond capable of hydrogen bonding; ethane has only dispersion forces. Methanol's boiling point ($65\,^\circ\text{C}$) is far higher than ethane's ($-89\,^\circ\text{C}$), confirming the rule. This stepwise check — hydrogen bonding, then dipole, then dispersion — is the reliable strategy for predicting relative physical properties from molecular structure alone.

## Solution

A **solution** is any value, or set of values, that makes an equation, inequality, or system of equations true when substituted for the unknown(s). Solving is the process of finding that value systematically, rather than guessing. Every solution must be verifiable: substituting it back into the original problem should produce a true statement. This verification step is what separates a rigorous solution from a lucky guess.

**Worked example.** Consider the linear equation $3x - 7 = 2x + 5$. To solve, isolate $x$ by performing the same operation on both sides. Subtract $2x$ from both sides: $x - 7 = 5$. Add 7 to both sides: $x = 12$. Check: $3(12) - 7 = 29$ and $2(12) + 5 = 29$. Both sides match, so $x = 12$ is confirmed as the solution.

Now consider a slightly harder case: the quadratic $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$. Factoring gives $(x-2)(x-3) = 0$, so $x = 2$ and $x = 3$ are both solutions — a reminder that a "solution" need not be unique. Substituting each value back confirms both satisfy the original equation.

**Problem-solving application.** In practice, most real problems don't arrive as a clean equation — they arrive as a scenario, and translating the scenario into an equation is the actual skill being tested. Suppose a rectangular garden's length is 3 meters more than its width, and its area is 40 square meters. Let $w$ represent the width; then the length is $w + 3$, and the area equation is $w(w+3) = 40$, or $w^2 + 3w - 40 = 0$. Factoring gives $(w+8)(w-5) = 0$, yielding $w = -8$ or $w = 5$. Here the algebra produces two mathematically valid roots, but only one is a valid *solution to the problem*: width cannot be negative, so $w = -8$ is rejected on physical grounds, leaving $w = 5$ meters (and length 8 meters) as the answer.

This distinction — between an equation's roots and a problem's admissible solutions — is central to applied problem-solving. Always check candidate solutions against both the original equation and the real-world constraints (domain restrictions, sign conventions, units) that the equation was built to represent.

## Solvent And Solute

A solution forms when one substance dissolves uniformly into another. The **solute** is the substance being dissolved and present in the smaller amount; the **solvent** is the substance doing the dissolving and present in the larger amount. When you stir sugar into water, sugar is the solute and water is the solvent. This distinction matters because the solvent's chemical properties — polarity, temperature, and molecular structure — largely determine how much solute can dissolve and how the mixture behaves.

Dissolving happens because solvent molecules surround and separate solute particles, overcoming the forces holding the solute together and replacing them with new solute–solvent interactions. Water, a polar molecule, dissolves other polar or ionic substances (like salt or sugar) but resists mixing with nonpolar substances (like oil). This "like dissolves like" principle explains why water and vegetable oil separate into layers instead of forming a solution: water molecules interact strongly with each other and with other polar molecules, but they cannot form comparable attractions with oil's nonpolar molecules.

**Worked example**: You dissolve 10 grams of salt into 200 grams of water. Which is the solute, and what is the solution's concentration by mass? Salt is the solute (smaller mass, being dissolved); water is the solvent. Total solution mass is $10 + 200 = 210$ g. Concentration by mass is:

$$
\text{mass percent} = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \times 100\% = \frac{10}{210} \times 100\% \approx 4.76\%
$$

**Problem-solving application**: Suppose you need to prepare 500 g of a 5% saline solution for a lab experiment. How much salt (solute) and how much water (solvent) do you need? Set up the mass-percent equation with the unknown solute mass $x$:

$$
0.05 = \frac{x}{500} \implies x = 25 \text{ g of salt}
$$

The remaining mass is solvent: $500 - 25 = 475$ g of water. This kind of calculation — rearranging the concentration formula to solve for an unknown component — is the core skill used throughout chemistry, from mixing lab reagents to formulating medications, where getting the solute-to-solvent ratio precisely right is essential for safety and effectiveness.

## Solvation

Solvation is the process by which solvent molecules surround and interact with the particles of a dissolved solute, stabilizing them in solution. When a solute — ionic, polar, or nonpolar — disperses into a solvent, it does not simply mix in passively; each solute particle becomes enveloped by a shell of solvent molecules oriented to maximize favorable electrostatic or intermolecular interactions. When the solvent is water, this specific case is called hydration. Solvation is the reason "like dissolves like": solvents dissolve solutes efficiently only when the intermolecular forces they can offer match the forces the solute needs replaced.

Consider table salt, NaCl, dissolving in water. Sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$) are held together in the solid by strong ionic bonds. Water molecules, being polar, have a partial negative charge on oxygen and partial positive charges on the hydrogens. When NaCl is added to water, the oxygen ends of water molecules cluster around each $\text{Na}^+$ ion, while the hydrogen ends orient toward each $\text{Cl}^-$ ion. This shell of oriented water molecules stabilizes the separated ions well enough that the energy released compensates for breaking the ionic lattice, so the salt dissolves. The same principle explains why oil does not dissolve in water: water cannot form comparably favorable interactions with oil's nonpolar hydrocarbon chains, so the nonpolar molecules are excluded rather than solvated.

Solvation also governs practical problem-solving in chemistry, biology, and engineering. Suppose you need to select a solvent to extract a nonpolar organic compound from an aqueous mixture. Applying the solvation principle, you would choose a nonpolar solvent, such as hexane or dichloromethane, because it can solvate the nonpolar compound through dispersion forces, while the polar water phase cannot. This is the working basis of liquid-liquid extraction, a standard laboratory separation technique. Similarly, in biology, the solvation of ions and polar side chains by water drives protein folding: nonpolar amino acid residues avoid unfavorable interactions with water and cluster in the protein's interior, while polar and charged residues remain solvated at the surface. Understanding solvation therefore lets you predict solubility, design separations, and reason about molecular structure across chemistry, materials science, and the life sciences.

## Dissolution Process

Dissolution is the process by which a solute disperses uniformly throughout a solvent to form a homogeneous mixture called a solution. At the particle level, dissolution requires three energy events: breaking apart solute-solute attractions, breaking apart solvent-solvent attractions, and forming new solute-solvent attractions. Whether a substance dissolves readily, slowly, or not at all depends on the balance between the energy required to separate particles and the energy released when new attractions form — summarized by the rule "like dissolves like," since polar solvents (such as water) dissolve polar or ionic solutes, while nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes.

**Worked example.** Consider table salt (NaCl) dissolving in water. Water molecules are polar, with a partial negative charge on oxygen and partial positive charges on hydrogen. When a salt crystal is added to water, the positive (sodium) ends of the ionic lattice attract the oxygen ends of water molecules, and the negative (chloride) ends attract the hydrogen ends. These attractions are strong enough to overcome the ionic bonds holding the crystal lattice together. Water molecules surround each $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$ ion individually — a process called hydration — pulling them away from the solid and into solution. This is why salt solutions conduct electricity: the ions are free to move independently, no longer locked in a fixed lattice.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you are asked to predict whether a spoonful of vegetable oil will dissolve in water, and how to speed up dissolution of sugar in iced tea versus hot tea. For the first question, oil is nonpolar and water is polar, so water molecules preferentially hydrogen-bond with each other rather than surround oil molecules — the oil remains a separate layer. For the second, dissolution rate depends on factors that increase collision frequency between solvent and solute: temperature (higher temperature gives molecules more kinetic energy, speeding hydration), surface area (crushed sugar dissolves faster than a cube, since more surface is exposed to solvent), and agitation (stirring continuously brings fresh solvent into contact with the solute). Applying these three factors together — using hot tea, granulated rather than cubed sugar, and stirring — explains why sugar dissolves almost instantly in hot tea but slowly, if at all, in unstirred iced tea.

## Partial Pressure

When several gases occupy the same container, each gas behaves as though it alone filled the entire volume. The pressure that a single gas contributes to the total is called its **partial pressure**. This idea is formalized in Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, which states that the total pressure of a gas mixture equals the sum of the partial pressures of its individual components:

$$P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \dots + P_n$$

Because pressure arises from the frequency and force of molecular collisions with the container walls, and because ideal gas molecules don't interact with one another, each gas's contribution to the total pressure depends only on how many of *its* molecules are present — not on what other gases are mixed in. The partial pressure of any component can be found from the ideal gas law, $P_i V = n_i R T$, or equivalently from the mole fraction: $P_i = x_i \cdot P_{total}$, where $x_i = n_i / n_{total}$.

**Worked example**: A rigid 10.0 L tank at 25°C contains 0.40 mol of nitrogen and 0.10 mol of oxygen. What is the partial pressure of each gas, and the total pressure?

Using $P_i = n_i R T / V$ with $R = 0.0821 \text{ L·atm/(mol·K)}$ and $T = 298 \text{ K}$:

$$P_{N_2} = \frac{(0.40)(0.0821)(298)}{10.0} \approx 0.979 \text{ atm}$$
$$P_{O_2} = \frac{(0.10)(0.0821)(298)}{10.0} \approx 0.245 \text{ atm}$$
$$P_{total} = 0.979 + 0.245 = 1.224 \text{ atm}$$

**Problem-solving application**: Partial pressure calculations matter whenever gases are collected or measured in mixed environments. A classic case is collecting a gas over water: the gas produced in a reaction bubbles up through water and collects in an inverted tube, but water itself evaporates, adding its own vapor pressure to the mixture. If a student collects hydrogen gas over water at 20°C where the total pressure is 1.00 atm and the known vapor pressure of water at that temperature is 0.023 atm, then the "dry" hydrogen pressure is found by subtraction: $P_{H_2} = 1.00 - 0.023 = 0.977 \text{ atm}$. This corrected value — not the total measured pressure — is what should be used in further stoichiometric calculations, since including water vapor would overstate the amount of hydrogen actually produced.

## Solubility

Solubility is the maximum amount of a substance (the solute) that will dissolve in a given quantity of solvent at a specified temperature to form a stable, saturated solution. It is typically expressed in grams of solute per 100 grams of solvent (g/100 g), or in molarity (mol/L) for chemistry applications. A solution holding less than this maximum is unsaturated; one that has somehow been pushed past it — usually by cooling a solution that was saturated at a higher temperature — is supersaturated, an unstable state where excess solute will crystallize out if disturbed.

Solubility depends on the chemical nature of both solute and solvent, temperature, and, for gases, pressure. The rule of thumb "like dissolves like" explains much of this: polar solvents such as water dissolve polar or ionic compounds well (table salt, sugar), while nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar compounds (oil, wax). For most solids in liquids, solubility increases with temperature, which is why sugar dissolves faster and more completely in hot tea than in iced tea. Gases behave oppositely — their solubility in liquids decreases as temperature rises, which is why a warm soda goes flat faster than a cold one, and why warmer lake water holds less dissolved oxygen, stressing fish populations.

**Worked example.** The solubility of potassium nitrate ($\text{KNO}_3$) in water is about 32 g per 100 g of water at 20°C and 110 g per 100 g at 60°C. Suppose you dissolve 90 g of $\text{KNO}_3$ in 100 g of water at 60°C, then cool the solution to 20°C. At 60°C, 90 g is below the 110 g limit, so the solution is unsaturated and everything stays dissolved. At 20°C, the limit drops to 32 g, so only 32 g can remain in solution — the remaining $90 - 32 = 58$ g crystallizes out as solid precipitate. This is the basis of recrystallization, a standard technique for purifying compounds: dissolve a solid in hot solvent, then cool it slowly so pure crystals form while impurities (present in smaller amounts) stay dissolved.

**Application.** Solubility calculations let chemists and engineers predict precipitation, design separation processes, and control drug formulation — for instance, determining how much of a medication will dissolve in stomach fluid at body temperature versus room temperature, which directly affects dosing and shelf stability.

## Henrys Law

At a fixed temperature, the amount of a gas that dissolves in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the liquid. This relationship, discovered by William Henry in 1803, is written as

$$C = k_H \, P$$

where $C$ is the concentration of dissolved gas in the liquid, $P$ is the partial pressure of the gas in contact with the liquid, and $k_H$ is the Henry's law constant — a value specific to each gas-liquid pair and temperature. Henry's law is a proportionality relationship, not a derived theorem, so its content is fully captured by this simple equation; no further formalism is needed to use it correctly.

Consider carbonated soda. Before the bottle is opened, the space above the liquid is pressurized with $\mathrm{CO_2}$ at several atmospheres, forcing a large amount of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ to dissolve into the liquid according to $C = k_H P$. When the cap is removed, the partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ above the liquid drops abruptly to the low level found in ordinary air. Because $C$ must fall in proportion to $P$, the liquid becomes supersaturated relative to the new equilibrium, and the excess gas escapes as visible bubbles — the fizz.

Henry's law becomes a genuine problem-solving tool once you treat $k_H$ as a known, tabulated constant and solve for whichever quantity is missing. Suppose a lake at $20\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ is in equilibrium with atmospheric air, where the partial pressure of oxygen is about $0.21\,\mathrm{atm}$, and the Henry's law constant for $\mathrm{O_2}$ in water at that temperature is $k_H \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{mol/(L\cdot atm)}$. The dissolved oxygen concentration is then

$$C = k_H P = (1.3\times10^{-3})(0.21) \approx 2.7\times10^{-4}\ \mathrm{mol/L}.$$

This is the calculation underlying real environmental questions: as water warms, $k_H$ for oxygen decreases (gas solubility drops with rising temperature), so warmer lakes and rivers hold less dissolved oxygen — a key reason why thermal pollution from power plants can stress fish populations even without any change in atmospheric pressure. The same relationship governs why divers must ascend slowly (dissolved nitrogen must leave the blood gradually as ambient pressure drops, avoiding the bubble formation known as decompression sickness) and why deep-sea creatures are adapted to gas concentrations that would be lethal at the surface.

## Decompression Sickness

Decompression sickness (DCS), commonly called "the bends," occurs when a diver or aviator experiences a drop in ambient pressure fast enough that inert gas dissolved in their tissues — mainly nitrogen — comes out of solution and forms bubbles inside the body. It is fundamentally a physics-and-physiology problem, not just a diving hazard: the same principle governs why a soda fizzes when you open the cap. Under pressure, more gas dissolves into a liquid (or tissue) than at normal pressure; when pressure drops abruptly, the excess gas escapes as bubbles rather than diffusing out gradually. In a diver's body, these bubbles can lodge in joints, the spinal cord, or the bloodstream, causing pain, numbness, paralysis, or in severe cases death.

**Worked example.** Consider a diver at 30 meters depth, where ambient pressure is about 4 atmospheres (1 atm at the surface plus roughly 1 atm per 10 meters of seawater). At this pressure, nitrogen dissolves into the diver's tissues at four times the concentration it would at the surface. If the diver ascends directly to the surface — dropping to 1 atm in seconds — the tissues are now supersaturated with nitrogen by a factor of four, and bubbles can form the way they do in a shaken soda can. This is why divers ascend slowly and pause at intermediate depths, called "decompression stops": each stop gives dissolved nitrogen time to diffuse out through the lungs and be exhaled, rather than escaping catastrophically as bubbles.

**Problem-solving application.** Dive planning uses tables or dive computers that model tissue nitrogen loading and calculate a safe ascent rate — typically no faster than about 9–18 meters per minute — plus required stop times at specific depths. Suppose a diver has been at 30 meters for 25 minutes; a dive table might specify a 3-minute stop at 5 meters before surfacing. The underlying logic is a rate problem: the body absorbs and releases nitrogen at a bounded rate depending on tissue type and blood flow, so the diver must budget ascent time so that the *rate* of pressure decrease never outpaces the *rate* at which nitrogen can safely diffuse out. This reframes DCS prevention as a scheduling problem — allocating time against a physiological constraint — the same logic engineers use when designing safe pressure-release protocols for industrial systems like pipelines or spacecraft airlocks, where rapid depressurization risks analogous failures.

---

## Payoff

Decompression sickness is where this book's threads finally converge: gas solubility, phase change, and physiological transport all collide in a single, high-stakes problem. A diver's tissues absorb dissolved nitrogen under pressure exactly as predicted by Henry's Law; ascend too quickly, and that same nitrogen comes out of solution as bubbles, exactly as predicted by the pressure-solubility relationship you studied earlier. Understanding decompression sickness is the natural endpoint of this book because it forces you to hold multiple concepts in your head simultaneously and use them to predict a real, measurable, dangerous outcome — not just recite a definition. It is the moment where "concept" becomes "consequence."

The connection to gas laws is direct: decompression tables and dive computers are essentially applied Henry's Law calculators, tracking dissolved nitrogen concentration in idealized tissue compartments and computing safe ascent rates that keep bubble formation below a physiological threshold. The connection to phase transitions is equally direct: a bubble is nothing more than a localized phase change from dissolved gas to gas phase, nucleating in blood vessels or joint tissue when local pressure drops below the saturation point. And the connection to human physiology closes the loop — bubbles lodging in joints cause the "bends," bubbles in the spinal cord or brain cause neurological injury, and bubbles in the lungs cause the "chokes." None of these outcomes make sense without the underlying chemistry; none of the chemistry matters without the physiological stakes.

This is also why decompression sickness is where engineering enters the picture. Dive tables (like the U.S. Navy tables) and modern dive computer algorithms (like Bühlmann ZH-L16) are worked solutions to the problem you now understand conceptually: given a depth, a bottom time, and a set of tissue half-times, compute a decompression schedule that never lets any compartment's gas tension exceed its tolerated supersaturation limit.

From here, you have a genuine application to explore in depth: pick either the design of a decompression algorithm (a computational, iterative problem) or the physiological case-study of bubble formation and its treatment via hyperbaric recompression (a biomedical problem). Both extend directly from what you've just learned — choose whichever pulls at your curiosity more.

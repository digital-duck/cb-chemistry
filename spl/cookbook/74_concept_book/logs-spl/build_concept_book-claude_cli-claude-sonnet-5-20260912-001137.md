## Oxidation

Oxidation is the loss of electrons by an atom, ion, or molecule during a chemical reaction. The term originated from reactions with oxygen, but the modern definition is broader: any species that loses electrons is oxidized, regardless of whether oxygen is involved. Oxidation always occurs together with reduction (electron gain) in what chemists call a redox reaction — electrons removed from one species must be accepted by another.

To track electron loss without drawing out every electron, chemists assign an **oxidation number** (or oxidation state) to each atom in a compound. This is a bookkeeping charge that an atom would have if all bonds were purely ionic. Rules include: elements in their natural form have an oxidation number of 0; oxygen is usually $-2$; hydrogen is usually $+1$; and the sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound equals 0 (or equals the ion's charge). When an atom's oxidation number increases, it has been oxidized.

**Worked example.** Consider the reaction:
$$
2\text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{MgO}
$$
In elemental magnesium, Mg has an oxidation number of 0. In MgO, magnesium is $+2$ and oxygen is $-2$. Magnesium's oxidation number rose from $0$ to $+2$, so magnesium was oxidized — it lost two electrons to oxygen. Oxygen's number fell from $0$ to $-2$, so oxygen was reduced.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given the reaction $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 2\text{Al} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + \text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ and asked to identify what is oxidized. Assign oxidation numbers: Al starts at 0 (elemental) and becomes $+3$ in $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ — an increase, so aluminum is oxidized. Iron starts at $+3$ in $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ and drops to 0 as elemental Fe — a decrease, so iron is reduced. This systematic approach — assign oxidation numbers before and after, then compare — works for identifying oxidation in any reaction, from rusting metal to combustion to the electron-transfer steps inside a battery, where the oxidized species is the one that ends up donating electrons at the anode.

## Oxidation Number

**Definition**

An oxidation number (or oxidation state) is a bookkeeping value assigned to an atom in a compound that represents the charge it would have if every bond were treated as fully ionic — that is, if all shared electrons were assigned to the more electronegative atom. It is not a real, measurable charge; it is an accounting convention that lets chemists track how electrons shift during a reaction. The rules are hierarchical: free elements are 0; monatomic ions equal their charge; oxygen is usually $-2$ (except peroxides, $-1$); hydrogen is usually $+1$ (except with metals, $-1$); fluorine is always $-1$; and the sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is 0, or equals the overall charge in a polyion.

**Worked example**

Find the oxidation number of manganese in $\text{KMnO}_4$. Potassium is a Group 1 metal, so it is $+1$. Oxygen follows its usual rule of $-2$, and there are four oxygens, contributing $-8$. Since the compound is neutral, the oxidation numbers must sum to zero:
$$(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0 \implies x = +7$$
So manganese is in the $+7$ oxidation state — a clue that $\text{KMnO}_4$ is a powerful oxidizing agent, since Mn(VII) can be reduced to lower, more stable states.

**Problem-solving application**

Oxidation numbers are most useful for identifying and balancing redox reactions, where tracking electron transfer by inspection is otherwise error-prone. Consider:
$$\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + \text{CO} \rightarrow \text{Fe} + \text{CO}_2$$
Assign oxidation numbers: Fe goes from $+3$ (in $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$) to $0$ (in Fe), a gain of 3 electrons per atom — reduction. Carbon goes from $+2$ (in CO) to $+4$ (in $\text{CO}_2$), a loss of 2 electrons — oxidation. To balance electrons lost and gained, you need 3 CO molecules (losing $3 \times 2 = 6$ electrons) for every 2 Fe atoms (gaining $2 \times 3 = 6$ electrons), giving the balanced equation $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 3\text{CO} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + 3\text{CO}_2$. This same technique — assign oxidation numbers, find what changes, match electrons transferred — is the standard first step for balancing any redox equation, including the more complex half-reaction method used in electrochemistry and titration problems.

## Reduction

**Reduction** is the process of showing that one problem can be solved by transforming it into another problem you already know how to solve. Instead of designing a new algorithm from scratch, you write a procedure that converts any instance of Problem A into an instance of Problem B, solves it using an existing method for B, and then converts the answer back. Reduction is the workhorse of computer science and mathematics: it is how new problems get connected to a shared toolbox of known solutions, and it is also the primary technique for proving that a problem is *hard* — if a known-hard problem reduces to yours, yours is at least as hard.

**Worked example.** Suppose you need to find the *maximum* value in a list, but you only have a working function `find_min(list)` that returns the minimum. Rather than writing a new search routine, negate every number in the list, run `find_min` on the negated list, and negate the result again:

```python
def find_max(nums):
    negated = [-x for x in nums]
    return -find_min(negated)
```

This is a genuine reduction: "find the max" has been transformed into "find the min," with a cheap conversion step (negation) on both ends. The correctness of `find_max` now rests entirely on the correctness of `find_min` — you don't need to reprove anything about searching.

**Problem-solving application.** Reductions are especially powerful for classifying problem difficulty. In computer science, a problem $P$ is shown to be NP-hard by taking a problem already known to be NP-hard, such as Boolean satisfiability (SAT), and constructing a polynomial-time transformation from SAT into $P$. If such a reduction exists, then any efficient algorithm for $P$ would also give an efficient algorithm for SAT — so $P$ inherits SAT's difficulty. This is why, when you encounter an unfamiliar optimization problem (say, scheduling jobs on machines to minimize delay), a productive first move is to ask: does this look like a disguised version of a problem I already know, such as bin-packing or the traveling salesman problem? If you can build a mapping between the two, you immediately gain access to decades of existing algorithms, complexity results, and heuristics — turning an unsolved problem into a solved one in translation.

## Electric Charge

Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that determines how a particle experiences and produces electromagnetic forces. Charge comes in two types, arbitrarily labeled positive and negative, and every observed charge is an integer multiple of the elementary charge $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{C}$. Protons carry charge $+e$, electrons carry $-e$, and neutrons carry none. Charge is conserved: in any isolated system, the total charge before an interaction equals the total charge after it. Like charges repel, opposite charges attract, and the strength of the interaction between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by distance $r$ is given by Coulomb's law,

$$F = k_e \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}, \qquad k_e = 8.99 \times 10^9\ \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2.$$

This inverse-square dependence is essential: it is not a stylistic choice but the mathematical statement that the force falls off as the field from a point charge spreads over a sphere of area $4\pi r^2$.

**Worked example.** Two small spheres, each carrying $2.0\ \mu\text{C}$, sit $0.30\ \text{m}$ apart in air. The force between them is

$$F = (8.99\times10^9)\frac{(2.0\times10^{-6})^2}{(0.30)^2} \approx 0.40\ \text{N}.$$

Since both charges are positive, the force is repulsive, directed along the line joining the spheres.

**Problem-solving application.** Coulomb's law becomes a design tool once several charges act on one object at the same time, because each pairwise force still points along the line between the two charges involved, and the net force is just the sum of these individual forces. Suppose a $+3\ \mu\text{C}$ charge sits at the origin and a $-3\ \mu\text{C}$ charge sits $0.20\ \text{m}$ to its right. A third, positive test charge placed further to the right is pulled left toward the negative charge and pushed left away from the positive charge, so both forces point the same direction and simply add — no cancellation is possible on that side. If the test charge is instead placed between the two fixed charges, the pull toward the negative charge and the push away from the positive charge act in opposite directions, and setting the two Coulomb-law expressions equal, $F_1 = F_2$, gives an equation that can be solved for the position where the net force is zero. This same bookkeeping — computing each pairwise force from Coulomb's law and combining the results — is what underlies the design of electrostatic sensors, ion traps, and models of how nearby charges influence a chosen point in a circuit or material.

## Redox Reaction

A redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction is any chemical process in which electrons transfer between species, causing changes in oxidation states. Oxidation is the loss of electrons (oxidation number increases); reduction is the gain of electrons (oxidation number decreases). These two processes always occur together — one substance cannot lose electrons unless another accepts them. The substance that loses electrons is the reducing agent (it reduces the other species while being oxidized itself); the substance that gains electrons is the oxidizing agent.

**Worked example.** Consider the reaction between zinc metal and copper(II) sulfate solution:
$$\text{Zn}(s) + \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + \text{Cu}(s)$$

Assign oxidation states: zinc goes from $0$ to $+2$, losing two electrons (oxidation). Copper goes from $+2$ to $0$, gaining two electrons (reduction). Zinc is the reducing agent; $\text{Cu}^{2+}$ is the oxidizing agent. We can split this into two half-reactions, which must balance in electrons transferred:
$$\text{Zn} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^- \quad \text{(oxidation)}$$
$$\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu} \quad \text{(reduction)}$$
Adding them cancels the $2e^-$ on each side, confirming charge and mass balance — the core check for any redox equation.

**Problem-solving application.** The half-reaction method is the general tool for balancing redox equations, especially in acidic or basic solution where oxygen and hydrogen must also balance. Steps: (1) split into oxidation and reduction half-reactions; (2) balance atoms other than O and H; (3) balance O using $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, then H using $\text{H}^+$ (add $\text{OH}^-$ on both sides afterward if the reaction is basic); (4) balance charge with electrons; (5) multiply each half-reaction so electron counts match, then add and simplify.

This procedure isn't just bookkeeping — it's the basis for predicting whether a reaction will proceed spontaneously (via standard reduction potentials), designing batteries and electrolytic cells, understanding corrosion, and analyzing biological electron-transport chains. Any time you see a change in oxidation number — combustion, rusting, photosynthesis, respiration — you are looking at a redox process, and the half-reaction toolkit is how you quantify it.

## Electrochemical Cell

An electrochemical cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy (or vice versa) by physically separating an oxidation reaction from a reduction reaction, forcing electrons to travel through an external wire rather than transferring directly between reacting species. Every electrochemical cell has two electrodes: the **anode**, where oxidation occurs (electrons are released), and the **cathode**, where reduction occurs (electrons are consumed). A salt bridge or porous membrane completes the internal circuit by allowing ions to migrate, which keeps each half-cell electrically neutral as electrons flow externally.

**Worked example.** Consider the classic zinc-copper cell: a zinc electrode in $\text{ZnSO}_4$ solution connected to a copper electrode in $\text{CuSO}_4$ solution. Zinc is more easily oxidized than copper, so at the anode:
$$\text{Zn}(s) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^-$$
At the cathode, copper ions are reduced:
$$\text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu}(s)$$
The overall reaction, $\text{Zn}(s) + \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + \text{Cu}(s)$, is spontaneous, and the electrons released at the zinc anode travel through the external wire to the copper cathode, producing a measurable voltage — about 1.10 V under standard conditions. This voltage comes from the difference in each metal's tendency to lose electrons, quantified by standard reduction potentials $E^\circ$.

**Problem-solving application.** To predict whether a proposed cell will generate a voltage — and how much — engineers and chemists use tabulated standard reduction potentials. The cell potential is:
$$E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}}$$
where both values are taken as reduction potentials from a reference table, and the electrode with the higher (more positive) reduction potential automatically becomes the cathode. For example, given $E^\circ(\text{Cu}^{2+}/\text{Cu}) = +0.34\text{ V}$ and $E^\circ(\text{Zn}^{2+}/\text{Zn}) = -0.76\text{ V}$, copper is assigned as the cathode: $E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = 0.34 - (-0.76) = 1.10\text{ V}$, matching the experimental result. This same reasoning underlies practical decisions — choosing electrode materials for batteries, diagnosing why a metal corrodes when paired with another (galvanic corrosion), or designing electroplating and electrolysis setups where an external power source reverses the spontaneous direction.

## Galvanic Cell

A galvanic cell (also called a voltaic cell) converts chemical energy into electrical energy through a spontaneous oxidation-reduction reaction. The reaction is physically split into two half-cells connected by a wire (for electron flow) and a salt bridge (for ion flow to maintain charge neutrality). At the anode, oxidation occurs and electrons are released; at the cathode, reduction occurs and electrons are consumed. Electrons flow spontaneously through the external wire from anode to cathode, generating a measurable voltage — the cell potential, $E_{cell}$.

**Worked example.** Consider the classic zinc-copper cell:

$$\text{Zn}(s) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \quad (\text{oxidation, anode})$$
$$\text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu}(s) \quad (\text{reduction, cathode})$$

The zinc electrode sits in a $\text{ZnSO}_4$ solution, the copper electrode in a $\text{CuSO}_4$ solution, and a salt bridge (often a KCl-saturated tube) connects the two. Using standard reduction potentials ($E^\circ_{\text{Cu}^{2+}/\text{Cu}} = +0.34\ \text{V}$, $E^\circ_{\text{Zn}^{2+}/\text{Zn}} = -0.76\ \text{V}$), the standard cell potential is:

$$E^\circ_{cell} = E^\circ_{cathode} - E^\circ_{anode} = 0.34 - (-0.76) = 1.10\ \text{V}$$

This positive value confirms the reaction is spontaneous, consistent with $\Delta G^\circ = -nFE^\circ_{cell} < 0$.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're asked to determine whether a silver-nickel cell will run spontaneously, and if so, to identify the anode and predict the voltage. Given $E^\circ_{\text{Ag}^+/\text{Ag}} = +0.80\ \text{V}$ and $E^\circ_{\text{Ni}^{2+}/\text{Ni}} = -0.25\ \text{V}$, the electrode with the higher (more positive) reduction potential — silver — becomes the cathode, and nickel, forced into oxidation, becomes the anode. The cell potential is $0.80 - (-0.25) = 1.05\ \text{V}$, a spontaneous cell.

This same logic underlies real batteries: a AA alkaline cell, a lithium-ion battery, and a car's lead-acid battery are all galvanic cells engineered for stable voltage, rechargeability, or high current output. When troubleshooting a "dead" battery or designing a new cell chemistry, the first question is always the same one this section answers: which half-reaction is spontaneous, and how do the electrode potentials combine to predict the voltage available to do work?

## Corrosion

Corrosion is the gradual degradation of a material, usually a metal, through chemical or electrochemical reaction with its environment. The most familiar case is the rusting of iron, in which iron reacts with oxygen and moisture to form hydrated iron oxide. Corrosion is fundamentally an electrochemical process: it involves oxidation, in which a metal atom loses electrons and becomes a positively charged ion, and reduction, in which those electrons are consumed elsewhere in the system, typically by oxygen and water. Because it requires an electron flow between two sites on a material, corrosion can be understood using the same principles that govern batteries — a fact that also explains how corrosion can be controlled.

Consider a steel ship hull sitting in seawater. At microscopic regions on the metal surface called anodic sites, iron atoms give up electrons: $\text{Fe} \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{2+} + 2e^-$. Those electrons travel through the metal to nearby cathodic sites, where they reduce dissolved oxygen: $\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-$. The $\text{Fe}^{2+}$ and $\text{OH}^-$ ions combine and further oxidize to form rust, $\text{Fe(OH)}_3$. Seawater's dissolved salts make it an excellent electrolyte, which is why ships corrode faster than the same steel would in dry air.

This electrochemical view leads directly to a practical engineering solution: cathodic protection. If corrosion depends on a metal losing electrons at an anodic site, engineers can prevent that loss by attaching a more reactive metal — such as zinc or magnesium — to the structure. Because zinc gives up electrons more readily than iron, it becomes the anode instead, sacrificing itself while forcing the iron to act as the protected cathode. This is why ship hulls, pipelines, and bridge supports are often fitted with replaceable zinc blocks called sacrificial anodes.

When solving a corrosion-protection problem, the key steps are: (1) identify which metal is more reactive using a standard reduction potential table, (2) confirm that an electrolyte pathway exists between the metals, and (3) select a sacrificial material reactive enough to protect the target structure but not so reactive that it depletes too quickly, since sacrificial anodes must be inspected and replaced periodically as part of routine maintenance.

## Galvanization

Galvanization is the process of applying a protective coating of zinc to iron or steel to prevent rusting. It works through two complementary mechanisms. First, the zinc layer acts as a physical barrier, sealing the underlying metal from oxygen and moisture, the two ingredients required for rust (hydrated iron oxide) to form. Second, and more importantly, zinc provides electrochemical protection: if the coating is scratched and the steel underneath is exposed, zinc corrodes preferentially instead of the iron. This happens because zinc is more reactive than iron — it sits higher on the activity series of metals, meaning it gives up electrons more readily. When both metals are exposed to moisture and air, an electrochemical cell forms, and zinc acts as the "sacrificial anode," oxidizing ($\text{Zn} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^-$) while the iron is protected as the cathode.

**Worked example.** Suppose a steel bracket is galvanized, but a small scratch exposes bare steel beneath the zinc coating. A technician wants to know whether the bracket will rust at the scratch site. Because zinc has a more negative standard reduction potential than iron ($E^\circ_{\text{Zn}^{2+}/\text{Zn}} = -0.76\text{ V}$ versus $E^\circ_{\text{Fe}^{2+}/\text{Fe}} = -0.44\text{ V}$), zinc is thermodynamically favored to oxidize first. The zinc surrounding the scratch will corrode, releasing electrons that flow to the exposed iron and suppress its oxidation. As long as zinc remains nearby, the iron is protected even where the coating is broken.

**Problem-solving application.** This principle explains why engineers choose galvanization over paint alone for outdoor structures like guardrails, chain-link fences, and ship hulls: paint only provides a physical barrier and fails once scratched, but zinc coatings self-protect against localized damage. It also explains the design of sacrificial anodes on ship hulls and underground pipelines, where blocks of zinc or magnesium are bolted onto the structure specifically to corrode instead of the steel. In troubleshooting corrosion failures, an engineer should ask not just "is there a protective coating?" but "does the coating remain more reactive than the metal it protects, and is there enough of it left to sacrifice?" Once the zinc is fully consumed, the underlying iron loses its protection and begins to rust rapidly, so periodic inspection and reapplication are essential parts of long-term corrosion management.

---

## Payoff

Galvanization — coating iron or steel with a sacrificial layer of zinc — is the natural endpoint of this book because it converts everything learned about oxidation, reduction, and electrochemical potential into a single, deployable solution to one of civilization's oldest problems: metal decay. Bare steel rusts because iron atoms lose electrons to oxygen in the presence of moisture, a process governed by the same redox principles studied earlier in this text. Galvanization does not stop that chemistry from happening; it redirects it. Zinc sits lower on the electrochemical series than iron, meaning it gives up its electrons more readily. When zinc and steel are in electrical contact, zinc oxidizes preferentially, protecting the steel underneath even where the coating is scratched — a mechanism called cathodic protection. The concept is elegant precisely because it doesn't fight the underlying chemistry; it exploits it.

This is why galvanization functions as a capstone: it is where corrosion theory, electrochemical series data, and materials engineering converge into a working product you can point to on a bridge or a fence post.

**Connections to applications.** In infrastructure and construction, galvanized rebar and structural steel extend the service life of bridges, guardrails, and building frames from years to decades, directly reducing maintenance cost and public safety risk. In the automotive industry, galvanized steel body panels resist the road salt and moisture that would otherwise perforate a car's frame within a single winter season, which is why galvanization became standard after warranty failures in the 1970s and '80s. In electrical and electronics manufacturing, galvanized enclosures and conduit protect wiring systems from environmental corrosion in outdoor and industrial settings. In marine and offshore engineering, galvanized fittings, chains, and structural components withstand saltwater exposure far longer than untreated steel, which is critical where inspection and replacement are expensive or physically difficult. In renewable energy infrastructure, galvanized steel towers and mounting structures for wind turbines and solar arrays must survive decades outdoors with minimal upkeep, making corrosion resistance an economic requirement, not a luxury.

Pick one of these domains — infrastructure, automotive, electronics, marine engineering, or renewable energy — and trace how galvanization's design choices (coating thickness, zinc purity, application method) are tuned to that domain's specific stresses. What tradeoffs would an engineer face differently in a bridge girder versus a turbine tower?

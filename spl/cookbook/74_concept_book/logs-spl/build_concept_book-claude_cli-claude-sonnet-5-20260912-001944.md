## Covalent Bonding

A covalent bond forms when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons, allowing each atom to attain a more stable, lower-energy electron configuration—typically a full outer shell of eight electrons (the octet rule) or two electrons for hydrogen. Unlike ionic bonding, where electrons transfer completely from one atom to another, covalent bonding involves electrons occupying a shared region of space between the two nuclei. This shared electron pair is attracted simultaneously to both nuclei, and that mutual attraction is what holds the atoms together.

Consider the formation of a chlorine molecule, $\text{Cl}_2$. Each chlorine atom has seven valence electrons and needs one more to complete its octet. Neither atom can simply take an electron from the other, since both have the same electronegativity. Instead, each contributes one electron to a shared pair, so both atoms effectively "count" eight electrons around themselves. The result is a single covalent bond, written $\text{Cl-Cl}$.

When solving structural problems, the key skill is determining how many bonds and lone pairs a molecule needs. A reliable method is to count total valence electrons across all atoms, then distribute them to give every atom (except hydrogen) an octet, using shared pairs for bonds and remaining pairs as lone pairs on individual atoms. Applying this to $\text{Cl}_2$: two chlorine atoms contribute seven electrons each, for a total of fourteen. One pair (two electrons) forms the shared bond between the atoms, leaving twelve electrons—six on each chlorine—distributed as three lone pairs per atom. Checking the result, each chlorine atom is now surrounded by eight electrons: two from the shared bond and six from its own lone pairs, satisfying the octet rule and confirming the structure is correct.

This bookkeeping approach—counting electrons, then assigning bonds and lone pairs to satisfy each atom's stability requirement—generalizes directly to more complex molecules with multiple atoms, multiple bonds, or double and triple bonds, and is the practical foundation for predicting molecular structure, which in turn determines a molecule's shape, polarity, and reactivity in later topics such as VSEPR theory and intermolecular forces.

## Oxidation State

Oxidation state (also called oxidation number) is a bookkeeping value assigned to an atom in a compound that represents the charge it would have if all bonds were treated as completely ionic. It is not necessarily a real, measurable charge — it is a formal accounting tool that tracks how electrons are distributed among atoms, which makes it indispensable for identifying and balancing oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions.

To assign oxidation states, chemists follow a hierarchy of rules: free elements are 0; monatomic ions equal their charge; oxygen is usually $-2$ (except in peroxides, where it is $-1$); hydrogen is usually $+1$ (except with metals, where it is $-1$); fluorine is always $-1$; and the sum of oxidation states in a neutral compound must equal 0, or must equal the overall charge in a polyatomic ion.

**Worked example.** Find the oxidation state of manganese in permanganate, $\text{MnO}_4^-$. Oxygen contributes $4 \times (-2) = -8$. Since the ion's total charge is $-1$, manganese must satisfy:
$$
x + (-8) = -1 \implies x = +7
$$
So manganese is in the $+7$ oxidation state — its most oxidized common form.

**Problem-solving application.** Oxidation states let you spot redox reactions even when they're disguised in complex-looking equations, by tracking which atoms gain electrons (reduction, oxidation state decreases) and which lose them (oxidation, oxidation state increases). Consider the reaction:
$$
\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 3\text{CO} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + 3\text{CO}_2
$$
Assign oxidation states: iron goes from $+3$ (in $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$) to $0$ (elemental iron), so it is reduced. Carbon goes from $+2$ (in CO) to $+4$ (in $\text{CO}_2$), so it is oxidized. This confirms the reaction is a redox process even though no ions or obvious "electron transfer" are visible in the formulas. This same technique — comparing an atom's oxidation state on each side of an equation — is exactly how chemists balance complex redox reactions using the half-reaction method, and how they predict whether a proposed reaction is even chemically plausible before running it in the lab.

## Electronegativity

Electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom attracts the shared electrons in a chemical bond toward itself. It is not a directly measurable physical quantity like mass or charge; rather, it is a comparative scale, built from bond energies, that lets chemists predict how electron density will be distributed when two atoms bond. The most widely used scale, developed by Linus Pauling, assigns dimensionless values ranging from about 0.7 (cesium) to 4.0 (fluorine). Across a period, electronegativity increases from left to right as nuclear charge grows while atomic radius shrinks, pulling bonding electrons closer to the nucleus. Down a group, electronegativity decreases as atomic radius increases and outer electrons sit farther from the nucleus, shielded by inner electron shells.

**Worked example.** Consider the bond in HCl. Chlorine's electronegativity is 3.16, hydrogen's is 2.20. The difference, $\Delta\chi = 3.16 - 2.20 = 0.96$, is large enough to make the bond polar covalent: chlorine pulls the shared electron pair toward itself, creating a partial negative charge ($\delta^-$) on Cl and a partial positive charge ($\delta^+$) on H. Compare this to the C–H bond in methane, where $\Delta\chi = 2.55 - 2.20 = 0.35$ — small enough that the bond is treated as essentially nonpolar.

**Problem-solving application.** Electronegativity differences let you predict both bond type and molecular behavior without running an experiment. As a rule of thumb: $\Delta\chi < 0.5$ indicates a nonpolar covalent bond, $0.5 \le \Delta\chi < 1.7$ indicates a polar covalent bond, and $\Delta\chi \ge 1.7$ indicates a bond that is predominantly ionic. Apply this to NaCl: $\chi_{\text{Cl}} - \chi_{\text{Na}} = 3.16 - 0.93 = 2.23$, correctly predicting an ionic bond. This same logic extends to predicting molecular polarity: in CO$_2$, each C=O bond is polar ($\Delta\chi = 3.44 - 2.55 = 0.89$), but the linear geometry causes the two bond dipoles to cancel, making the overall molecule nonpolar — a reminder that electronegativity predicts bond polarity, while molecular polarity also depends on geometry. This combined reasoning is essential for predicting solubility, boiling points, and reactivity patterns across organic and inorganic chemistry.

## Periodic Table Groups

**Definition.** The periodic table arranges the 118 known elements into rows (periods) and columns (groups, or families). Elements in the same group share the same number of valence electrons — the electrons in the outermost occupied shell — which is why they display similar chemical behavior. For example, Group 1 (the alkali metals: Li, Na, K, ...) each have one valence electron and react vigorously with water; Group 17 (the halogens: F, Cl, Br, ...) each have seven valence electrons and readily gain one more to complete a stable octet. Group 18 (the noble gases) have a full valence shell and are chemically inert under most conditions. This organization is not arbitrary bookkeeping — it reflects the quantum-mechanical structure of electron shells, so knowing an element's group tells you a great deal about its reactivity, bonding tendencies, and physical properties without memorizing each element individually.

**Worked example.** Suppose you're asked to predict the formula of the compound formed between magnesium (Mg, Group 2) and chlorine (Cl, Group 17). Mg has 2 valence electrons and tends to lose both to reach a stable configuration, forming Mg$^{2+}$. Cl has 7 valence electrons and tends to gain 1 to form Cl$^-$. To balance charge, you need two Cl$^-$ ions for every Mg$^{2+}$ ion, giving the formula MgCl$_2$. This is exactly the reasoning chemists use before ever running an experiment — group position alone predicts the ionic charge and, from there, the compound's stoichiometry.

**Problem-solving application.** Group position is a diagnostic tool. Given an unfamiliar element, you can locate its group to predict: (1) its likely ionic charge (Group 1 → +1, Group 2 → +2, Group 16 → −2, Group 17 → −1), (2) whether it will form compounds with a given partner and in what ratio, and (3) trends like reactivity (increasing down Group 1, decreasing down Group 17) or atomic size (increasing down any group). For instance, to predict the formula for the compound between aluminum (Group 13, forms Al$^{3+}$) and oxygen (Group 16, forms O$^{2-}$), find the least common multiple of the charges (6), requiring 2 Al and 3 O: Al$_2$O$_3$. Practicing this charge-balancing method across many group pairs builds the same predictive fluency a chemist uses when encountering a new reaction.

## Nonmetals

Nonmetals are elements that generally lack the properties characteristic of metals: they are poor conductors of heat and electricity, tend to be brittle or soft rather than malleable, and — with the exception of carbon in some forms — are not lustrous. On the periodic table, nonmetals occupy the upper right region, including hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine), and the noble gases. Chemically, nonmetals tend to gain or share electrons rather than lose them, because their atoms have relatively high electronegativity and hold their valence electrons tightly. This behavior distinguishes them sharply from metals, which tend to lose electrons and form cations.

Consider oxygen and sulfur, both nonmetals in Group 16. When oxygen reacts with a metal like magnesium, it gains two electrons to form the oxide ion, $O^{2-}$, while magnesium loses two electrons to form $Mg^{2+}$, producing the ionic compound $MgO$. But when two nonmetals react with each other, neither has enough of an electronegativity advantage to fully strip electrons from the other. Instead, they share electron pairs, forming covalent bonds — as seen in water ($H_2O$), carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), and ammonia ($NH_3$).

This gain-or-share tendency lets you predict bonding behavior without memorizing every compound. Suppose you're asked to classify the bonding in $SiCl_4$ (silicon tetrachloride) versus $NaCl$ (sodium chloride). Silicon and chlorine are both nonmetals (silicon is a metalloid but behaves nonmetallically here), so you'd predict covalent bonding — correct, as $SiCl_4$ is a molecular compound with a low melting point. Sodium, however, is a metal, so $NaCl$ should be ionic, consistent with its high melting point and electrical conductivity when molten or dissolved.

This reasoning extends to a practical skill: given an unfamiliar formula, first classify each element as metal or nonmetal, then predict whether the bonding is ionic (metal + nonmetal) or covalent (nonmetal + nonmetal). This single distinction — whether electrons transfer or share — underlies why table salt dissolves in water and conducts electricity, while sugar dissolves but does not, and why nonmetal-rich compounds like plastics are electrical insulators.

## Nitrogen Fixation

Nitrogen makes up 78% of Earth's atmosphere, yet most organisms cannot use it in its gaseous form, $N_2$. The two nitrogen atoms in $N_2$ are joined by a triple bond, one of the strongest bonds in chemistry, so breaking it apart requires either enormous amounts of energy or a highly specialized biological catalyst. Nitrogen fixation is the process of converting inert atmospheric $N_2$ into ammonia ($NH_3$) or related compounds that plants and other organisms can absorb and build into amino acids, nucleotides, and proteins. Without it, nitrogen would remain locked in the air, unusable, and life as we know it could not sustain itself.

Biological nitrogen fixation is carried out almost exclusively by certain bacteria and archaea, using an enzyme complex called nitrogenase. The best-known example is *Rhizobium*, a bacterium that lives in nodules on the roots of legumes such as beans, peas, and clover. Inside these nodules, *Rhizobium* fixes nitrogen in exchange for sugars supplied by the plant — a mutualistic relationship. The reaction, simplified, is:

$$N_2 + 8H^+ + 8e^- + 16\,ATP \rightarrow 2NH_3 + H_2 + 16\,ADP + 16\,P_i$$

Notice the steep energy cost: sixteen ATP molecules per reaction cycle. This is why nitrogen fixation is biologically expensive and why nitrogenase only operates in oxygen-poor environments — oxygen destroys the enzyme.

Consider a practical application: a farmer wants to improve soil fertility without relying entirely on synthetic fertilizer, which is manufactured industrially through the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process (which also converts $N_2$ to $NH_3$, but using high heat and pressure instead of enzymes). By rotating crops — planting soybeans or clover one season, then corn the next — the farmer allows legume-associated bacteria to enrich the soil with fixed nitrogen. This reduces fertilizer costs, limits nitrogen runoff into waterways (a major cause of algal blooms), and improves long-term soil health.

This comparison illustrates a broader problem-solving principle: when a process is metabolically or industrially costly, look for ways nature already solves it efficiently, and design systems — agricultural, chemical, or engineered — that work with those biological mechanisms rather than replacing them outright.

## Acid Anhydride

An acid anhydride is a compound formed when two molecules of a carboxylic acid combine and lose one molecule of water. The name literally means "without water" — anhydrides are, in effect, dehydrated acids. Structurally, an anhydride replaces the $-\text{OH}$ of a carboxylic acid with an $-\text{O}-\text{C}(=\text{O})-R$ group, giving the general form $R\text{-CO-O-CO-}R'$. When both acid units are the same, the product is a symmetrical anhydride; when they differ, it is a mixed anhydride. The most familiar example is acetic anhydride, $(\text{CH}_3\text{CO})_2\text{O}$, formed conceptually from two acetic acid molecules:
$$2\,\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \rightarrow (\text{CH}_3\text{CO})_2\text{O} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

Worked example: Acetic anhydride is industrially important because it is a far more reactive acylating agent than acetic acid itself. When acetic anhydride reacts with salicylic acid, it transfers an acetyl group ($\text{CH}_3\text{CO}-$) to the hydroxyl group of salicylic acid, producing acetylsalicylic acid — aspirin — and regenerating acetic acid as a byproduct:
$$\text{C}_7\text{H}_6\text{O}_3 + (\text{CH}_3\text{CO})_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{C}_9\text{H}_8\text{O}_4 + \text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$$
This reaction is the basis of the classic aspirin-synthesis lab exercise: anhydrides react faster and more cleanly than the parent acid because the leaving group (a carboxylate) is more stable than a hydroxide, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and easier to attack.

Problem-solving application: Suppose you need to acetylate a hydroxyl-containing drug precursor but must avoid generating strongly acidic byproducts that could degrade an acid-sensitive functional group elsewhere in the molecule. Using acetic acid directly would require harsh conditions (strong acid catalyst, removal of water, high temperature) because esterification with a free acid is an equilibrium reaction. Using acetic anhydride instead solves this: the reaction proceeds essentially to completion under mild conditions, and the only byproduct is acetic acid — a weak acid, easily washed out — rather than a strong mineral acid. This is why anhydrides, not raw carboxylic acids, are the reagent of choice in pharmaceutical and polymer synthesis (e.g., cellulose acetate production) whenever a clean, irreversible acylation is required. Recognizing an anhydride's greater electrophilicity and leaving-group stability lets you predict which acylating agent to choose for a given synthetic constraint.

## Haber Process

The Haber process is an industrial method for synthesizing ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$) by reacting nitrogen gas from the air with hydrogen gas, using a catalyst and controlled conditions of temperature and pressure. The overall reaction is:

$$\text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3(g)$$

This reaction is reversible and exothermic, and it does not proceed at a useful rate under ordinary conditions — nitrogen's triple bond ($\text{N}\equiv\text{N}$) is extremely strong and resists breaking. Fritz Haber discovered in 1909 that an iron-based catalyst, combined with high pressure (150–300 atmospheres) and moderate-to-high temperature (400–500°C), makes the reaction commercially viable. Carl Bosch later scaled this into industrial practice, so the process is often called the Haber-Bosch process.

**Worked example.** Because the forward reaction is exothermic and reduces the number of gas molecules (4 moles of reactant gas → 2 moles of product gas), Le Chatelier's principle tells us two things: lowering temperature favors ammonia formation (equilibrium shifts to release less heat), but so does raising pressure (equilibrium shifts toward fewer gas molecules). Yet industrial plants don't run at very low temperatures, because reaction rate would become impractically slow — even with a catalyst. Engineers instead accept a compromise: moderate temperature (400–500°C) sacrifices some equilibrium yield in exchange for a workable reaction rate, and high pressure (150–300 atm) partially compensates by pushing yield back up. Unreacted $\text{N}_2$ and $\text{H}_2$ are recycled continuously, so even a modest per-pass conversion (typically 10–20%) becomes highly efficient overall.

**Problem-solving application.** This trade-off — rate versus equilibrium position — is a recurring theme in industrial chemistry and process engineering, not just this one reaction. When designing or evaluating any equilibrium-driven process, ask: (1) which direction does Le Chatelier's principle favor for the desired product? (2) what conditions maximize rate, and do they conflict with the equilibrium-favoring conditions? (3) can a catalyst decouple these by speeding up the reaction without shifting equilibrium? The Haber process is also foundational because synthetic ammonia underlies most nitrogen fertilizers, making it one of the few chemical reactions credited with reshaping global food production and population growth.

## Oxyacids

An oxyacid (or oxoacid) is an acid that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and a central nonmetal atom, with the acidic hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom rather than directly to the central atom. Common examples include sulfuric acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$), nitric acid ($\text{HNO}_3$), phosphoric acid ($\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4$), and carbonic acid ($\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$). The general pattern is $\text{H}_n\text{XO}_m$, where X is the central nonmetal (S, N, P, Cl, C, etc.). When these acids dissolve in water, the O–H bond breaks heterolytically, releasing $\text{H}^+$ and leaving behind an oxyanion (such as $\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ or $\text{NO}_3^-$).

**Worked example.** Compare the acid strength of $\text{HClO}$ (hypochlorous acid) and $\text{HClO}_4$ (perchloric acid). Both have chlorine as the central atom bonded to oxygen, but $\text{HClO}_4$ has three additional oxygen atoms not bonded to hydrogen, while $\text{HClO}$ has none. Oxygen is highly electronegative, so each extra oxygen pulls electron density away from the O–H bond through the chlorine atom, weakening that bond and stabilizing the resulting anion by spreading its negative charge over more atoms. As a result, $\text{HClO}_4$ ionizes almost completely in water (a strong acid), while $\text{HClO}$ only partially ionizes (a weak acid, $K_a \approx 3.0 \times 10^{-8}$). This trend — more oxygens attached to the central atom means a stronger acid — holds across the halogen oxyacid series ($\text{HClO} < \text{HClO}_2 < \text{HClO}_3 < \text{HClO}_4$).

**Problem-solving application.** This rule lets you predict relative acid strength without memorizing every $K_a$ value. Suppose you're asked to rank $\text{H}_2\text{SO}_3$ and $\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$ by strength: since sulfuric acid has one more oxygen atom on the same central atom (S), it should be the stronger acid — which matches experimental data ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$ is a strong acid; $\text{H}_2\text{SO}_3$ is weak). The same logic explains why acids of different central atoms in the same oxidation state and group behave predictably: electronegativity of the central atom also matters, so $\text{HClO}$ is a stronger acid than $\text{HBrO}$, since chlorine is more electronegative than bromine and pulls electron density from the O–H bond more effectively. Combining "count the extra oxygens" with "compare electronegativity of the central atom" gives a reliable, calculation-free method for ranking oxyacid strength on exams or in the lab.

## Ostwald Process

The Ostwald process is the industrial method for converting ammonia into nitric acid, a compound essential for fertilizers, explosives, and countless chemical products. Developed by Wilhelm Ostwald in 1902, the process proceeds in three stages, each a distinct chemical reaction carried out under carefully controlled conditions.

**Stage 1 — Catalytic oxidation of ammonia:**
$$4NH_3(g) + 5O_2(g) \xrightarrow{Pt/Rh, 800-950°C} 4NO(g) + 6H_2O(g)$$
Ammonia gas is mixed with excess air and passed over a platinum-rhodium gauze catalyst at high temperature. This step is exothermic, and once ignited, the reaction largely sustains its own heat.

**Stage 2 — Oxidation of nitric oxide:**
$$2NO(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2NO_2(g)$$
The nitric oxide is cooled and reacts further with atmospheric oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide.

**Stage 3 — Absorption in water:**
$$3NO_2(g) + H_2O(l) \rightarrow 2HNO_3(aq) + NO(g)$$
Nitrogen dioxide is absorbed into water to produce nitric acid, while the byproduct NO is recycled back into Stage 2, improving overall yield.

**Worked example:** Suppose a plant feeds 1000 kg of ammonia into the process, and the overall conversion efficiency (accounting for losses at each stage) is 90%. First find the moles of $NH_3$: $1000\text{ kg} / 17\text{ g/mol} \approx 58{,}824\text{ mol}$. Since the overall stoichiometry from Stage 1 through Stage 3 converts each mole of $NH_3$ into one mole of $HNO_3$ (tracing nitrogen atoms through all three equations), the theoretical yield is $58{,}824\text{ mol} \times 63\text{ g/mol} \approx 3706\text{ kg}$ of $HNO_3$. Applying 90% efficiency gives an actual yield of about $3335\text{ kg}$.

**Problem-solving application:** This kind of multi-stage stoichiometric tracking — following a single atom (here, nitrogen) through a sequence of reactions to establish an overall input-output ratio — is a general technique for analyzing industrial chemical processes. Given a target output of nitric acid and a specified plant efficiency, you can work backward to determine the required ammonia feed rate, a calculation directly relevant to process engineering and cost estimation in industrial chemistry.

## Payoff

The Ostwald process is the point where the concept-book's separate threads — catalysis, reaction kinetics, equilibrium, and industrial-scale process design — converge into a single working system. Individually, each of those ideas explains a piece of chemical behavior; together, in the Ostwald process, they explain how humanity manufactures a compound, nitric acid, at the scale of tens of millions of tons per year, starting from nothing more than air, ammonia, and a platinum-rhodium gauze. That is why it is the natural capstone: it is not a new concept so much as a demonstration that everything learned so far is powerful enough to design and run a real industrial system, not just predict the outcome of a beaker reaction.

The process itself is a sequence of three catalyzed and equilibrium-governed steps: ammonia is oxidized over a hot platinum catalyst to nitric oxide, the nitric oxide is further oxidized to nitrogen dioxide as it cools, and the nitrogen dioxide is absorbed in water to yield nitric acid. Each step is a case study in the exact tools built earlier in the book — choosing a catalyst that speeds the desired pathway without favoring side reactions, controlling temperature and pressure to shift equilibrium toward the product, and managing reaction rate against heat removal so the system stays stable rather than runs away.

This is also where the applied payoff becomes concrete. Nitric acid produced this way is the feedstock for ammonium nitrate fertilizer, which underpins the world's food supply; it is a precursor for explosives and propellants, tying the same chemistry to defense and mining industries; it factors into the industrial synthesis of dyes, plastics, and pharmaceuticals that require nitration steps; and understanding its byproducts connects directly to atmospheric chemistry and nitrogen oxide pollution control, since incomplete or poorly managed catalysis in analogous systems is a major source of $\text{NO}_x$ emissions.

Pick one of these — agriculture, energy and explosives, materials synthesis, or environmental regulation — and trace how the Ostwald process's core mechanism reappears, adapted, as the starting point for solving that domain's central chemical problem.

## Organic Compound

An organic compound is any molecule built primarily from carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen, along with common partners such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or halogens. Carbon's defining feature is its ability to form four stable covalent bonds and link to other carbon atoms in chains, branches, and rings, producing an enormous diversity of structures from a small set of elements. This is why over 20 million organic compounds are known, compared to a much smaller number of inorganic ones. Compounds lacking carbon-hydrogen bonds — like carbon dioxide, carbonates, or diamond — are classified as inorganic even though they contain carbon.

**Worked example.** Consider ethanol, $\mathrm{C_2H_6O}$, versus dimethyl ether, also $\mathrm{C_2H_6O}$. Both share the identical molecular formula, yet they behave completely differently: ethanol is a liquid that mixes with water and burns as fuel, while dimethyl ether is a gas used as a refrigerant and aerosol propellant. The difference lies in structure — ethanol has an -OH group attached to a carbon chain ($\mathrm{CH_3CH_2OH}$), while dimethyl ether has an oxygen bridging two methyl groups ($\mathrm{CH_3OCH_3}$). This illustrates a core principle of organic chemistry: molecular formula alone does not determine identity or properties — the arrangement of atoms (the structural formula) does. Compounds with the same formula but different structures are called isomers, and predicting or distinguishing them is a routine task in identifying unknown organic samples.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a chemist isolates an unknown compound with formula $\mathrm{C_3H_8O}$ and needs to determine which of three possible isomers it is: 1-propanol, 2-propanol, or methyl ethyl ether. Rather than guessing, they apply functional group tests: adding sodium metal produces bubbling hydrogen gas if an -OH group is present (both propanol isomers react; the ether does not), while oxidation with a mild oxidizer converts 1-propanol to an aldehyde but 2-propanol to a ketone — distinguishable by further chemical tests or spectroscopy. This process of narrowing down structure from formula, functional groups, and reactivity is the practical skill organic chemists use daily, whether identifying a natural product, verifying a synthesis, or characterizing an unknown environmental sample.

## Carbon Tetravalence

Every carbon atom forms exactly four covalent bonds. This behavior, called tetravalence, follows directly from carbon's electron configuration: $1s^2\,2s^2\,2p^2$. Carbon has six electrons total, but only the four in its outer (valence) shell — two in the $2s$ orbital and two in the $2p$ orbitals — are available for bonding. To achieve a stable octet (eight valence electrons, matching the nearest noble gas, neon), carbon must gain, in effect, four more electrons by sharing them with other atoms. It does this by forming four single covalent bonds, or fewer bonds with some doubled or tripled in bond order, as long as the total bonding capacity sums to four.

Consider methane, $\text{CH}_4$. Carbon shares one electron with each of four hydrogen atoms, and each hydrogen shares its single electron back, giving carbon a full octet and each hydrogen a full duet. The same principle explains carbon dioxide, $\text{CO}_2$: carbon forms two double bonds, one with each oxygen atom. A double bond counts as two shared electron pairs, so two double bonds still total four bonds' worth of shared electrons — tetravalence is satisfied even though carbon is bonded to only two other atoms rather than four.

Tetravalence becomes a practical problem-solving tool when predicting molecular structure. Given a molecular formula, you can often deduce the connectivity by asking: how must carbon's four bonds be distributed to satisfy every atom's valence requirement? Take ethylene, $\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$. Each carbon needs four bonds total. If the two carbons form a double bond between them (using two of each carbon's four bonds), each carbon has two bonds remaining, which it uses to bond with two hydrogen atoms. This matches the formula exactly and correctly predicts the planar, double-bonded structure of ethylene, rather than, say, a single C–C bond with mismatched hydrogen counts.

This bond-counting method scales to more complex organic molecules. Before drawing a full structure, check that every carbon's bonds sum to four, every hydrogen's sum to one, and every oxygen's typically sum to two. Structures that violate this constraint are chemically impossible, making tetravalence a fast, reliable filter for eliminating incorrect candidate structures.

## Functional Group

A functional group is a specific arrangement of atoms within a molecule that behaves as a predictable unit, giving the molecule characteristic chemical reactivity regardless of the rest of the structure it's attached to. Instead of memorizing the behavior of every individual organic molecule — an impossible task given there are millions — chemists organize molecules by their functional groups, because the group, not the overall molecule, largely determines how a compound reacts. A hydroxyl group ($-OH$), for example, confers similar reactivity whether it's attached to a two-carbon molecule (ethanol) or a twenty-carbon one: both undergo oxidation, esterification, and dehydration in analogous ways.

**Worked example.** Consider three molecules: ethane ($CH_3CH_3$), ethanol ($CH_3CH_2OH$), and acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$). Ethane has no functional group beyond its carbon-hydrogen backbone and is largely unreactive. Ethanol contains a hydroxyl group, making it capable of hydrogen bonding (hence its higher boiling point and water solubility compared to ethane) and reactive toward oxidation. Oxidizing the hydroxyl group's carbon further converts ethanol into acetic acid, which contains a carboxyl group ($-COOH$). The carboxyl group is acidic — it readily donates a proton in water — a property neither ethane nor ethanol possesses. Moving from $-H$ to $-OH$ to $-COOH$ on the same two-carbon skeleton systematically increases polarity, water solubility, and reactivity, illustrating how functional groups — not carbon count — drive chemical behavior.

**Problem-solving application.** Functional groups let you predict reaction outcomes and design synthesis pathways without knowing a molecule's full identity. Suppose you're given an unlabeled compound that turns a solution of chromic acid from orange to green (an oxidation test) but does not react with sodium bicarbonate (a test for acidity). You can infer it likely contains a hydroxyl group (oxidizable) rather than a carboxyl group (which would react with bicarbonate) or an ether (which resists oxidation and testing). In biochemistry, this same logic explains why amino acids — bearing both amine ($-NH_2$) and carboxyl groups — can act as both bases and acids, a property essential to their role as buffers and to protein folding. Recognizing functional groups converts organic chemistry from rote memorization into a system of transferable reaction rules.

## Hydrocarbon

A hydrocarbon is a molecule made of only carbon and hydrogen atoms, bonded together by covalent bonds. Carbon's ability to form four stable bonds—with other carbons or with hydrogen—lets these molecules build up as straight chains, branched chains, or rings, producing enormous structural variety from just two elements. Chemists classify hydrocarbons by bonding pattern: alkanes contain only single bonds (saturated), alkenes contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond, alkynes contain at least one triple bond, and aromatic hydrocarbons (like benzene) contain a ring of alternating or delocalized double bonds. This classification matters because bond type directly determines reactivity, melting/boiling point trends, and how the molecule burns or reacts with other substances.

**Worked example.** Consider methane ($\text{CH}_4$) and ethylene ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$). Methane is a saturated alkane—each carbon uses all four bonds to hold hydrogens, so it is chemically stable and burns cleanly:
$$\text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$
Ethylene, by contrast, has a carbon-carbon double bond, leaving it "unsaturated." That double bond is reactive: it can open up and add other atoms across it, which is exactly how ethylene molecules link together into long chains to form polyethylene plastic. The same underlying logic—single bonds are stable and unreactive, double/triple bonds are reactive sites—explains why alkanes are used as fuels while alkenes are the building blocks (monomers) of the plastics industry.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given a hydrocarbon with the formula $\text{C}_4\text{H}_8$ and asked whether it's an alkane, alkene, or cycloalkane. First check the general saturation formula for an acyclic alkane, $\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n+2}$: for $n=4$, that would be $\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}$. Since the given molecule has two fewer hydrogens, it must contain either one double bond (an alkene, matching $\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n}$) or one ring (a cycloalkane, which also fits $\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n}$)—the molecular formula alone can't distinguish them, so you'd need additional structural information, such as a reaction test with bromine water (alkenes decolorize it rapidly; cycloalkanes do not). This kind of degree-of-unsaturation reasoning is a standard first step in identifying unknown organic compounds from formula data alone.

## Alcohol

An alcohol is an organic compound in which a hydroxyl group ($-\text{OH}$) is bonded to a saturated carbon atom. This functional group defines the chemistry of the entire class: the oxygen's electronegativity and its two lone pairs make alcohols polar, capable of hydrogen bonding with water and with each other, and reactive at the carbon-oxygen or oxygen-hydrogen bond depending on conditions. Alcohols are classified by how many carbon groups attach to the carbon bearing the $-\text{OH}$: primary (one), secondary (two), or tertiary (three). This classification matters because it predicts reactivity — for instance, primary alcohols oxidize to aldehydes and then carboxylic acids, while tertiary alcohols resist oxidation entirely because there is no hydrogen left on that carbon to remove.

**Worked example.** Consider ethanol, $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH}$, the alcohol produced by fermentation and used as a fuel additive and disinfectant. Its carbon bearing the $-\text{OH}$ is attached to only one other carbon, so ethanol is primary. Its physical properties — a boiling point of 78°C, far higher than ethane's -89°C — come directly from hydrogen bonding between $-\text{OH}$ groups, a pattern general to all alcohols compared with hydrocarbons of similar size.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given an unlabeled sample and told it's either 1-propanol, 2-propanol, or 2-methyl-2-propanol (tert-butanol), and you need to identify it using a simple oxidation test with an oxidizing agent like chromic acid, which turns from orange to green when it successfully oxidizes an alcohol.
- 1-propanol (primary): oxidizes readily, color changes.
- 2-propanol (secondary): oxidizes to a ketone, color changes.
- 2-methyl-2-propanol (tertiary): no reaction, color stays orange.

If your sample shows no color change, you can immediately rule out both primary and secondary structures and conclude it's tertiary — because the test isn't detecting "alcohol" generically, it's detecting the presence of a removable hydrogen on the hydroxyl-bearing carbon. This illustrates the broader problem-solving principle: classifying a functional group by its structural detail (here, degree of substitution) lets you predict — and diagnose — chemical behavior rather than memorizing it case by case.

## Hybridization

When two atoms form a bond, the electrons involved don't simply occupy the plain $s$ and $p$ orbitals you'd predict from an atom's electron configuration. Instead, atoms often mix, or "hybridize," their atomic orbitals into a new set of equivalent orbitals better suited for bonding. Hybridization explains why methane's four C–H bonds are identical in length and angle (109.5°), even though carbon's ground-state configuration ($2s^2 2p^2$) would naively suggest two unequal bond types from unequal orbitals.

The rule is straightforward: the number of hybrid orbitals formed equals the number of atomic orbitals mixed, and that number is determined by counting the atom's electron domains (bonding groups plus lone pairs). One $s$ and three $p$ orbitals combine to form four $sp^3$ orbitals (tetrahedral, 109.5°); one $s$ and two $p$ orbitals form three $sp^2$ orbitals (trigonal planar, 120°); one $s$ and one $p$ orbital form two $sp$ orbitals (linear, 180°).

**Worked example.** Consider ethylene, $\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$. Each carbon has three electron domains: two C–H bonds and one C=C bond (a double bond counts as one domain). Three domains → $sp^2$ hybridization → trigonal planar geometry with 120° bond angles. The unhybridized $p$ orbital on each carbon, left perpendicular to the plane, overlaps sideways with its neighbor to form the $\pi$ bond of the double bond, while the $sp^2$ orbitals form the $\sigma$ framework. This is why ethylene is flat and rigid — rotation around the C=C bond would break the $\pi$ overlap.

**Problem-solving application.** Given a molecule's Lewis structure, you can predict hybridization and geometry in three steps: (1) draw the structure and count electron domains around the atom of interest, (2) match that count to a hybridization scheme (2→$sp$, 3→$sp^2$, 4→$sp^3$), and (3) assign geometry accordingly, remembering that lone pairs count as domains but aren't shown in the final molecular shape. Try this on $\text{XeF}_4$: xenon has six domains (4 bonds + 2 lone pairs), giving $sp^3d^2$ hybridization and octahedral electron geometry — but square planar molecular geometry once the two lone pairs are placed opposite each other to minimize repulsion.

## Oxidation Number

**Definition**

An oxidation number (or oxidation state) is a bookkeeping value assigned to an atom in a compound that represents the charge it would have if every bond were treated as fully ionic — that is, if all shared electrons were assigned to the more electronegative atom. It is not a real, measurable charge; it is an accounting convention that lets chemists track how electrons shift during a reaction. The rules are hierarchical: free elements are 0; monatomic ions equal their charge; oxygen is usually $-2$ (except peroxides, $-1$); hydrogen is usually $+1$ (except with metals, $-1$); fluorine is always $-1$; and the sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is 0, or equals the overall charge in a polyion.

**Worked example**

Find the oxidation number of manganese in $\text{KMnO}_4$. Potassium is a Group 1 metal, so it is $+1$. Oxygen follows its usual rule of $-2$, and there are four oxygens, contributing $-8$. Since the compound is neutral, the oxidation numbers must sum to zero:
$$(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0 \implies x = +7$$
So manganese is in the $+7$ oxidation state — a clue that $\text{KMnO}_4$ is a powerful oxidizing agent, since Mn(VII) can be reduced to lower, more stable states.

**Problem-solving application**

Oxidation numbers are most useful for identifying and balancing redox reactions, where tracking electron transfer by inspection is otherwise error-prone. Consider:
$$\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + \text{CO} \rightarrow \text{Fe} + \text{CO}_2$$
Assign oxidation numbers: Fe goes from $+3$ (in $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$) to $0$ (in Fe), a gain of 3 electrons per atom — reduction. Carbon goes from $+2$ (in CO) to $+4$ (in $\text{CO}_2$), a loss of 2 electrons — oxidation. To balance electrons lost and gained, you need 3 CO molecules (losing $3 \times 2 = 6$ electrons) for every 2 Fe atoms (gaining $2 \times 3 = 6$ electrons), giving the balanced equation $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 3\text{CO} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + 3\text{CO}_2$. This same technique — assign oxidation numbers, find what changes, match electrons transferred — is the standard first step for balancing any redox equation, including the more complex half-reaction method used in electrochemistry and titration problems.

## Carbonyl Group

**Definition**

A carbonyl group is a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom, written $\text{C=O}$. This single structural feature is the reactive core of an entire family of organic molecules — aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, and amides all contain it, differing only in what else is attached to that carbon. The oxygen is far more electronegative than carbon, so the double bond is polarized: the carbon carries a partial positive charge ($\delta^+$) and the oxygen a partial negative charge ($\delta^-$). This polarity is the reason carbonyl compounds behave predictably in chemical reactions — the electron-poor carbon becomes a target for anything electron-rich looking to attack it.

**Worked example**

Consider acetone, $(\text{CH}_3)_2\text{C=O}$, the solvent in nail-polish remover. Its carbonyl carbon is bonded to two methyl groups and double-bonded to oxygen. Because that carbon is $\delta^+$, a nucleophile — an electron-rich species such as a hydroxide ion ($\text{OH}^-$) — is drawn to attack it directly. The oxygen's electrons shift fully onto the oxygen atom, temporarily breaking the double bond and forming a negatively charged oxygen (an alkoxide intermediate). This addition step is the opening move in countless organic transformations, from industrial synthesis to the metabolic reactions that break down sugars in your cells.

**Problem-solving application**

Suppose you're given two molecules — ethanol ($\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH}$) and acetaldehyde ($\text{CH}_3\text{CHO}$) — and asked to predict which one reacts faster with a nucleophile like cyanide ion ($\text{CN}^-$). The reasoning: ethanol has no carbonyl group, so its carbon atoms carry no meaningful $\delta^+$ charge and are poor targets for nucleophilic attack. Acetaldehyde has a carbonyl carbon that is distinctly electron-poor, making it reactive toward $\text{CN}^-$. This single question generalizes into a reliable diagnostic skill: whenever you need to predict or explain reactivity in an organic molecule, first locate any carbonyl groups, because they are almost always the site where a reaction will initiate. This same logic explains why aldehydes tend to be more reactive than ketones (less steric crowding around the carbonyl carbon) and why carboxylic acid derivatives (esters, amides) react differently depending on what group is attached next to the carbonyl — a pattern you can use to predict outcomes even for carbonyl compounds you have never seen before.

---

## Oxidation Reduction Organic

**Definition.** In organic chemistry, oxidation and reduction are tracked not by electron transfer (as in ionic redox) but by changes in bonds to oxygen and hydrogen. A carbon atom is oxidized when it forms more bonds to oxygen (or other electronegative atoms like N, halogens) or fewer bonds to hydrogen. It is reduced when the reverse happens: more bonds to hydrogen, fewer to oxygen. This gives a practical ranking of common functional groups by oxidation state at a given carbon, from most reduced to most oxidized: alkane $\to$ alcohol $\to$ aldehyde/ketone $\to$ carboxylic acid $\to$ CO$_2$. Each arrow represents a one-step oxidation; reading backward is a reduction.

**Worked example.** Consider ethanol, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH. Its oxidation removes two hydrogens from the carbon bearing the OH group, producing acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO. This is the reaction your liver performs (via alcohol dehydrogenase) and the one at the heart of a breathalyzer test, where a chromium(VI) reagent turns from orange to green as it oxidizes ethanol vapor and is itself reduced. A second oxidation of acetaldehyde adds an oxygen to give acetic acid, CH$_3$COOH — the reaction that turns wine into vinegar. Notice the pattern: each oxidation step either adds a C–O bond or removes a C–H bond, never changes both loosely — this is the diagnostic to use when scanning an unfamiliar transformation.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given a reaction scheme and asked to identify which reagent is the oxidizing agent and predict the product. First, classify the starting functional group (alcohol, aldehyde, etc.) using the ranking above. Then check the reagent: strong oxidants like KMnO$_4$ or CrO$_3$ push a primary alcohol all the way to a carboxylic acid, while a milder, controlled oxidant (e.g., pyridinium chlorochromate, PCC) stops at the aldehyde stage by avoiding the water needed for further oxidation. Conversely, reducing agents like NaBH$_4$ or LiAlH$_4$ convert carbonyls back toward alcohols, with LiAlH$_4$ being strong enough to reduce even carboxylic acids and esters, while NaBH$_4$ only handles aldehydes and ketones. This reagent-strength distinction — not just "oxidizer vs. reducer" — is usually the deciding factor in real synthesis problems, since choosing too strong a reagent overshoots the intended product.

---

## Aldehyde

An aldehyde is an organic compound containing a carbonyl group (a carbon double-bonded to oxygen, $\mathrm{C=O}$) in which the carbonyl carbon is bonded to at least one hydrogen atom. The general structural formula is $\mathrm{R\text{-}CHO}$, where R is a hydrogen atom or a carbon-based group. This places the carbonyl carbon at the *end* of a carbon chain, distinguishing aldehydes from ketones, where the carbonyl carbon sits between two carbon groups. Common examples include formaldehyde ($\mathrm{HCHO}$), used in preserving biological specimens and manufacturing resins, and acetaldehyde ($\mathrm{CH_3CHO}$), an intermediate in alcohol metabolism in the human body.

**Worked example.** Consider ethanol, $\mathrm{CH_3CH_2OH}$, undergoing oxidation. A primary alcohol, when partially oxidized (for instance, by a mild oxidizing agent like pyridinium chlorochromate, or biologically by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase), loses two hydrogen atoms to form an aldehyde: $\mathrm{CH_3CH_2OH} \rightarrow \mathrm{CH_3CHO}$ (acetaldehyde). If oxidation continues further, the aldehyde is converted into a carboxylic acid, $\mathrm{CH_3COOH}$ (acetic acid). This two-step oxidation pathway — alcohol to aldehyde to acid — is a chemical mechanism at the heart of human physiology: when the body metabolizes ingested ethanol, it first produces acetaldehyde, a toxic compound responsible for many symptoms of alcohol intoxication and hangovers, before further oxidizing it into harmless acetic acid.

**Problem-solving application.** Aldehyde chemistry is directly useful for identifying unknown compounds in a lab setting, a common practical task in organic chemistry. Aldehydes are easily oxidized (because of that available hydrogen on the carbonyl carbon), so they react positively with mild oxidizing test reagents such as Tollens' reagent (silver mirror test) or Fehling's solution, while ketones — lacking that hydrogen — do not react. If you are given an unlabeled compound and told it is either an aldehyde or a ketone, applying Tollens' test and observing a silver precipitate confirms it is an aldehyde. This same reasoning underlies real diagnostic and industrial applications: detecting reducing sugars in urine (an early diabetes screening method relied on this exact chemistry) and quality-testing intermediates in fragrance and flavor manufacturing, where aldehydes such as vanillin and cinnamaldehyde are prized for their characteristic scents and must be distinguished from related, non-reactive ketone byproducts.

## Amine

An amine is an organic compound derived from ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$) in which one, two, or three hydrogen atoms are replaced by carbon-containing (alkyl or aryl) groups. This substitution pattern classifies amines as primary (1°), secondary (2°), or tertiary (3°): a primary amine like methylamine ($\text{CH}_3\text{NH}_2$) has one carbon group attached to nitrogen, a secondary amine like dimethylamine ($(\text{CH}_3)_2\text{NH}$) has two, and a tertiary amine like trimethylamine ($(\text{CH}_3)_3\text{N}$) has three. The defining feature of every amine is the nitrogen atom's lone pair of electrons, which makes amines both basic and nucleophilic — they readily accept protons and readily attack electron-poor carbon centers.

**Worked example.** Consider why amines are weak bases in water, a property that distinguishes them from neutral hydrocarbons. The nitrogen's lone pair can accept a proton from water:
$$\text{CH}_3\text{NH}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{NH}_3^+ + \text{OH}^-$$
This equilibrium lies only partially to the right (methylamine has $K_b \approx 4.4 \times 10^{-4}$), so a solution of methylamine is basic but not strongly so — comparable in strength to ammonia itself. The basicity depends on how available the lone pair is: electron-donating alkyl groups tend to increase it, while nearby electron-withdrawing groups or aromatic rings (as in aniline) decrease it by pulling electron density away from nitrogen.

**Problem-solving application.** Amine basicity is exploited constantly in pharmaceutical chemistry and drug formulation. Many drugs — antihistamines, local anesthetics, antidepressants — contain an amine group that is nearly insoluble in water in its neutral form but becomes water-soluble once protonated. Suppose you need to convert a poorly soluble amine-containing drug into an injectable solution: treating it with a mild acid like hydrochloric acid converts the neutral amine ($\text{R-NH}_2$) into its ammonium salt ($\text{R-NH}_3^+\text{Cl}^-$), which dissolves readily in aqueous solution. This is precisely why so many drug names end in "hydrochloride" (e.g., diphenhydramine hydrochloride) — the manufacturer has deliberately protonated the amine to control solubility, stability, and how the body absorbs the compound.

---

## Carboxylic Acid

A carboxylic acid is an organic compound containing the carboxyl group, $-\text{COOH}$, in which a carbon atom is double-bonded to one oxygen and single-bonded to a hydroxyl group ($-\text{OH}$). The general formula is $\text{R-COOH}$, where R is a hydrocarbon chain. This functional group makes the compound acidic because the O–H bond can release a proton ($\text{H}^+$), and the resulting carboxylate anion ($\text{R-COO}^-$) is stabilized by resonance — the negative charge is delocalized across both oxygen atoms rather than sitting on just one. This resonance stabilization is why carboxylic acids are far more acidic than simple alcohols, even though both contain an O–H bond.

**Worked example.** Consider acetic acid, $\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$, the acid in vinegar, with $K_a \approx 1.8 \times 10^{-5}$. When dissolved in water, it partially ionizes:
$$\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}^+$$
Using the equilibrium expression $K_a = \dfrac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}$, a 0.10 M solution yields a pH of about 2.87 — acidic, but much weaker than a strong acid like HCl at the same concentration, since only a small fraction of molecules ionize.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given an unlabeled 0.050 M solution of a carboxylic acid with measured pH 3.00, and asked to identify $K_a$. First find $[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-3.00} = 1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ M. Assuming $[\text{H}^+] \approx [\text{R-COO}^-]$ and that ionization is small relative to the initial concentration:
$$K_a \approx \frac{(1.0\times10^{-3})^2}{0.050 - 1.0\times10^{-3}} \approx 2.0\times10^{-5}$$
This value is close to that of acetic acid, letting you narrow down the identity of the acid by comparing to a reference table of $K_a$ values. This kind of reasoning — working backward from measured pH to $K_a$, then to structure — is exactly how chemists identify unknown acids in a lab setting, and it also explains everyday chemistry: why vinegar stings less than battery acid, why soap (a carboxylate salt) forms when fatty acids react with base, and why citric acid in fruit tastes sour but doesn't burn skin the way a strong mineral acid would.

---

## Amide

An amide is a functional group formed when a carboxylic acid (–COOH) reacts with an amine (–NH₂ or a substituted nitrogen), releasing water and joining a carbonyl carbon directly to a nitrogen atom. The core structure is R–C(=O)–NH–R′, where the carbonyl carbon carries a double-bonded oxygen and a single bond to nitrogen. This C(=O)–N linkage is the defining feature of amides, and it is also the bond that holds proteins together — there, it is called a peptide bond. Amides are notably stable and resistant to hydrolysis compared to esters, because the nitrogen's lone pair delocalizes into the carbonyl system, giving the C–N bond partial double-bond character. This resonance restricts rotation around that bond, a fact with real structural consequences in biology.

**Worked example.** Consider the synthesis of acetamide from acetic acid and ammonia:
$$\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{NH}_3 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CONH}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$
The carboxylic acid's –OH is replaced by –NH₂, with water as the byproduct. In practice, this direct reaction is slow at room temperature, so chemists often first convert the acid to a more reactive derivative — an acid chloride (R–COCl) — then treat it with the amine, which reacts rapidly and gives a cleaner yield.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you need to identify the monomer linkage in nylon-6,6, a polymer formed from a diamine and a diacid. Each repeat unit forms two amide bonds, alternating –C(=O)–NH– along the chain — this is why nylon is chemically a polyamide. Recognizing the amide bond lets you predict its properties: because the C–N bond resists rotation and the N–H can hydrogen-bond with neighboring C=O groups, polyamide chains pack tightly and form strong intermolecular hydrogen-bonded sheets, which is exactly why nylon fibers are strong and why proteins fold into stable secondary structures like the alpha helix and beta sheet. If you are asked why proteins denature under heat but do not simply fall apart into individual amino acids, the answer hinges on this same distinction: heat disrupts the hydrogen bonds and folding pattern, but the covalent amide (peptide) backbone itself survives, since breaking it requires hydrolysis, not just added thermal energy. This is the practical payoff of understanding the amide group — it explains both synthetic polymer strength and the structural backbone of life's proteins with one shared chemical logic.

---

## Amidation

Amidation is the chemical reaction that forms an amide bond, joining a carboxylic acid derivative to an amine while releasing a small byproduct such as water or an alcohol. The resulting functional group, $-\text{C}(=\text{O})-\text{NH}-$, is one of the most important linkages in chemistry and biology: it is the peptide bond that strings amino acids into proteins, and it appears in nylon, in many pharmaceuticals (such as acetaminophen and penicillin), and in countless industrial polymers. Because the carbonyl carbon is electrophilic and the amine nitrogen is nucleophilic, amidation is fundamentally a nucleophilic substitution — the amine attacks the carbonyl carbon, displacing a leaving group.

**Worked example.** Consider converting acetic acid ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$) into acetamide ($\text{CH}_3\text{CONH}_2$) using ammonia. Direct reaction of a carboxylic acid with an amine is slow at room temperature because the amine first acts as a base, deprotonating the acid to form an unreactive ammonium carboxylate salt. To drive the reaction forward, chemists typically convert the acid into a more reactive derivative first — commonly an acid chloride ($\text{CH}_3\text{COCl}$) using thionyl chloride ($\text{SOCl}_2$). The acid chloride then reacts readily with ammonia: the nitrogen lone pair attacks the carbonyl carbon, chloride ion leaves, and after loss of a proton the product is acetamide plus $\text{HCl}$. This two-step strategy — activate, then couple — is the standard logic behind nearly all synthetic amidations.

**Problem-solving application.** This activation strategy is exactly what protein synthesis machinery and pharmaceutical chemists both exploit, just with different tools. In the ribosome, the "activation" is done enzymatically: amino acids are first attached to transfer RNA via a high-energy ester bond before peptide bond formation. In the lab, chemists use coupling reagents like EDC or DCC, which activate the carboxylic acid's oxygen into a good leaving group so an amine can attack efficiently, without needing harsh conditions that might damage other parts of a complex molecule. When designing a synthesis route for a drug that requires an amide linkage, the key problem-solving question is always the same: which activation method will react selectively at the amide bond without disturbing other functional groups already present in the molecule?

---

## Payoff

Amidation — the formation of a carbon–nitrogen bond between a carboxylic acid (or an activated derivative, such as an acid chloride or ester) and an amine, releasing water or another small leaving group — is the natural endpoint of this book's progression through carbonyl chemistry. Earlier concepts built the vocabulary: nucleophilic acyl substitution explained how a tetrahedral intermediate forms and collapses; leaving-group ability explained why acid chlorides react faster than esters; and acid-base chemistry explained why a free amine, not its protonated ammonium salt, is the reactive species. Amidation is where those pieces converge into a single, robust, and enormously consequential transformation: it produces the amide bond, one of the most stable and most useful linkages in organic chemistry.

That stability is precisely what makes amidation the natural capstone. Because the amide bond resists hydrolysis far better than an ester does — its resonance-delocalized nitrogen lone pair makes the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic — it is the bond nature and industry both reach for when durability under biological or environmental conditions is required.

This is why amidation connects outward in so many directions at once. In biochemistry, it is the peptide bond: every protein in your body is a polymer built by iterated amidation between amino acids, so understanding this one reaction is the gateway to understanding enzymes, hormones, and antibody structure. In pharmaceutical chemistry, amidation is a workhorse step in drug synthesis, used to attach pharmacophores or improve a molecule's metabolic stability and solubility — many marketed drugs owe their core scaffold to an amide bond installed exactly this way. In materials science, industrial amidation between diacids and diamines produces nylon and related polyamides, translating a benchtop reaction into fibers, textiles, and engineering plastics. In agrochemistry, amide-based herbicides and fungicides rely on the same bond's resistance to premature breakdown in soil and water.

Amidation therefore isn't just "one more reaction" — it's the mechanistic idea that unlocks how proteins are built, how many drugs are made, and how some of the toughest synthetic materials are engineered. Pick one of these threads — protein synthesis, drug design, or polymer manufacturing — and trace how the same carbon-nitrogen bond-forming logic scales from a single flask to a living cell or a factory floor.

## Element

An **element** (also called a *member*) is any single object that belongs to a set. If $S = \{2, 4, 6, 8\}$, then $6$ is an element of $S$, written $6 \in S$. The symbol $\notin$ means "is not an element of": $7 \notin S$. Elements can be numbers, strings, functions, other sets — anything. What matters is only whether an object is inside the collection or not; there is no concept of duplicates or order at this level.

Formally, a set is entirely defined by its elements. Two sets are equal if and only if they contain exactly the same elements:

$$A = B \iff (\forall x,\; x \in A \Leftrightarrow x \in B)$$

This is called the **axiom of extensionality**. It means $\{1, 2, 3\} = \{3, 1, 2\}$ — order is irrelevant — and $\{1, 1, 2\} = \{1, 2\}$ — repetition is irrelevant.

**Worked example.** Let $P$ be the set of prime numbers less than 20:

$$P = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19\}$$

Is $15 \in P$? Since $15 = 3 \times 5$, it is composite, so $15 \notin P$. Is $\sqrt{4} \in P$? $\sqrt{4} = 2$, and $2 \in P$, so yes. The check is always the same: evaluate the object, then test membership against the defining rule or list.

**Problem-solving application.** Membership testing is the foundation of filtering in code. Given a list of user-submitted values, you want only the valid options:

```python
VALID_GRADES = {"A", "B", "C", "D", "F"}

submissions = ["A", "Z", "B", "Pass", "C"]
clean = [g for g in submissions if g in VALID_GRADES]
# clean → ["A", "B", "C"]
```

Here `VALID_GRADES` is a Python `set`, and `g in VALID_GRADES` is exactly the mathematical test $g \in S$ — executed in $O(1)$ average time because sets use hashing. Swapping the container from a list to a set doesn't change the concept; it just makes the membership test fast. Recognizing "is this object in this collection?" as an element-membership question lets you choose the right data structure — set for fast lookup, list when order or duplicates matter — and reason clearly about correctness before writing a single line.

## Matter

**Matter** is anything that has mass and occupies space. From the air you breathe to the screen you're reading, all physical substances are matter. Understanding matter means understanding how it is classified, how it behaves, and how its properties can be measured and predicted.

Matter exists in distinct **phases** — solid, liquid, gas, and plasma — each defined by how its particles are arranged and how freely they move. In a solid, particles are locked in fixed positions and vibrate in place. In a liquid, they remain close but slide past one another. In a gas, particles move rapidly and spread to fill any container. Plasma, the fourth phase, consists of ionized gas and is the most abundant form of matter in the universe, found in stars and lightning bolts.

Chemists classify matter further by composition. A **pure substance** has a fixed, uniform composition — either a single element (like oxygen, O₂) or a compound (like water, H₂O) with atoms bonded in a definite ratio. Everything else is a **mixture**: two or more substances combined physically, not chemically, so the components retain their individual properties and can be separated by physical means such as filtration or distillation.

**Worked example.** Saltwater is a mixture — the salt dissolves uniformly throughout the water, but no chemical bonds form between them. To recover pure water, you boil the solution: water evaporates, salt stays behind, and condensing the steam gives you distilled water. The salt was never chemically changed; it dissolves and re-crystallizes intact.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a lab sample is described as "a silvery solid that melts at 29.8 °C, conducts electricity, and cannot be broken into simpler substances by chemical means." Each clue maps to a classification: melts near room temperature → physical property; conducts electricity → metallic behavior; cannot be broken down chemically → element, not compound. The substance is gallium (Ga). Applying the matter classification framework — phase, then pure substance vs. mixture, then element vs. compound — lets you identify unknowns from observable evidence without guesswork.

This framework underlies nearly every branch of science and engineering, from designing alloys to purifying pharmaceuticals.

## Dalton's Atomic Theory

By the early 1800s, chemists had noticed something strange in their data: when elements combine to form compounds, they always do so in fixed, whole-number mass ratios. Ten grams of hydrogen always combines with about 80 grams of oxygen to make water, never with 79 or 81. John Dalton, an English schoolteacher, proposed an explanation in 1803 that became the foundation of modern chemistry: matter is composed of indivisible particles called atoms, each element has atoms of a single characteristic mass, atoms are neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions, and compounds form when atoms combine in fixed whole-number ratios.

**Worked example.** Consider carbon and oxygen, which form two distinct compounds: carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). If atoms combine in fixed whole-number ratios, then for a fixed mass of carbon, the masses of oxygen in these two compounds should stand in a small whole-number ratio. Experimentally, 12 g of carbon combines with 16 g of oxygen in CO, and with 32 g of oxygen in CO₂. The ratio of oxygen masses is $32:16 = 2:1$ — exactly what you'd expect if CO₂ simply contains twice as many oxygen atoms per carbon atom as CO. This 2:1 ratio, discovered from mass measurements alone, was strong indirect evidence for atoms decades before anyone could see one.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose nitrogen and oxygen form two compounds. In compound A, 14 g of nitrogen combines with 16 g of oxygen. In compound B, 14 g of nitrogen combines with 32 g of oxygen. Using Dalton's reasoning, find the ratio of oxygen atoms per nitrogen atom in each compound and identify plausible formulas. The oxygen mass ratio for a fixed nitrogen mass is $32:16 = 2:1$, so compound B has twice the oxygen-to-nitrogen ratio of compound A — consistent with NO and NO₂. This kind of reasoning is exactly how chemists assign formulas today: measure mass ratios experimentally, reduce them to small whole numbers, and infer atomic composition. Dalton's theory later required refinement, but the core insight, that discrete, countable atomic units explain mass ratios, remains the bedrock of stoichiometry and chemical formula-writing.

## Atom

An **atom** is the smallest unit of an element that retains that element's chemical identity. Atoms are the building blocks of all ordinary matter — every solid, liquid, and gas you encounter is made of atoms bonded together or moving freely. Each atom consists of a dense, positively charged **nucleus** (containing protons and neutrons) surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged **electrons**. The number of protons in the nucleus is the **atomic number** ($Z$), which uniquely identifies the element. A neutral atom has exactly as many electrons as protons. The **mass number** ($A$) equals the total count of protons and neutrons: $A = Z + N$, where $N$ is the number of neutrons.

**Worked example.** A neutral atom has 17 protons and 18 neutrons. Identify the element, write its symbol, and determine how many electrons it has.

- $Z = 17$ → element is **Chlorine (Cl)**
- $A = 17 + 18 = 35$ → symbol: $^{35}_{17}\text{Cl}$
- Neutral atom: electrons $= Z = 17$

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you are given a mystery atom with mass number 23 and 12 neutrons. Find $Z$, identify the element, and predict whether it is likely to gain or lose electrons in a chemical reaction.

Step 1: $Z = A - N = 23 - 12 = 11$ → **Sodium (Na)**  
Step 2: Sodium sits in Group 1 of the periodic table, meaning it has 1 valence electron. Atoms seek a stable octet; losing that single electron costs far less energy than gaining seven. Sodium therefore **loses 1 electron** to form $\text{Na}^+$.

This reasoning — atomic number gives identity, valence electron count predicts reactivity — is the core skill. Every chemical equation, every material property, and every biological molecule ultimately traces back to how individual atoms are structured and how they interact.

## Electric Charge

Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that determines how a particle experiences and produces electromagnetic forces. Charge comes in two types, arbitrarily labeled positive and negative, and every observed charge is an integer multiple of the elementary charge $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{C}$. Protons carry charge $+e$, electrons carry $-e$, and neutrons carry none. Charge is conserved: in any isolated system, the total charge before an interaction equals the total charge after it. Like charges repel, opposite charges attract, and the strength of the interaction between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by distance $r$ is given by Coulomb's law,

$$F = k_e \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}, \qquad k_e = 8.99 \times 10^9\ \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2.$$

This inverse-square dependence is essential: it is not a stylistic choice but the mathematical statement that the force falls off as the field from a point charge spreads over a sphere of area $4\pi r^2$.

**Worked example.** Two small spheres, each carrying $2.0\ \mu\text{C}$, sit $0.30\ \text{m}$ apart in air. The force between them is

$$F = (8.99\times10^9)\frac{(2.0\times10^{-6})^2}{(0.30)^2} \approx 0.40\ \text{N}.$$

Since both charges are positive, the force is repulsive, directed along the line joining the spheres.

**Problem-solving application.** Coulomb's law becomes a design tool once several charges act on one object at the same time, because each pairwise force still points along the line between the two charges involved, and the net force is just the sum of these individual forces. Suppose a $+3\ \mu\text{C}$ charge sits at the origin and a $-3\ \mu\text{C}$ charge sits $0.20\ \text{m}$ to its right. A third, positive test charge placed further to the right is pulled left toward the negative charge and pushed left away from the positive charge, so both forces point the same direction and simply add — no cancellation is possible on that side. If the test charge is instead placed between the two fixed charges, the pull toward the negative charge and the push away from the positive charge act in opposite directions, and setting the two Coulomb-law expressions equal, $F_1 = F_2$, gives an equation that can be solved for the position where the net force is zero. This same bookkeeping — computing each pairwise force from Coulomb's law and combining the results — is what underlies the design of electrostatic sensors, ion traps, and models of how nearby charges influence a chosen point in a circuit or material.

## Electron

An electron is a subatomic particle carrying a single unit of negative electric charge, approximately $-1.602 \times 10^{-19}\text{ C}$, and a mass of about $9.109 \times 10^{-31}\text{ kg}$ — roughly 1/1836 the mass of a proton. Electrons occupy the space around an atomic nucleus, and their arrangement determines nearly every chemical and electrical property of matter: how atoms bond, how materials conduct electricity, and how light interacts with substances. Unlike a planet orbiting the sun, an electron does not follow a fixed path; quantum mechanics describes its location only probabilistically, in terms of regions called orbitals where it is likely to be found.

**Worked example.** Consider a neutral carbon atom, atomic number 6, meaning it has 6 protons and therefore 6 electrons. These electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy: 2 electrons occupy the innermost shell, and the remaining 4 occupy the second shell. This second-shell arrangement of 4 electrons — not enough to fill the shell, but more than half full — is exactly why carbon can form four bonds with other atoms, making it the backbone of organic chemistry. Contrast this with neon (atomic number 10), whose second shell is completely full with 8 electrons, leaving it chemically inert. The number of outer, or "valence," electrons is the single most predictive fact about how an element behaves.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you are asked to predict whether magnesium (atomic number 12) will tend to lose or gain electrons when forming a compound. Its electron arrangement is 2, 8, 2 — two electrons sit alone in the outermost shell. Removing those two is easier than acquiring six more to fill the shell, so magnesium loses them, forming a $\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion. This same reasoning — count the valence electrons, then judge whether losing or gaining fewer electrons gets the atom to a full outer shell — lets you predict the charge and reactivity of almost any element on the periodic table, and explains why table salt forms as $\text{Na}^+\text{Cl}^-$ rather than some other combination. This predictive power is what makes the electron, despite its tiny mass, central to chemistry, materials science, and electrical engineering alike.

## Ion

An ion is an atom or molecule that has gained or lost one or more electrons, giving it a net electric charge. In a neutral atom, the number of protons (positive charge) equals the number of electrons (negative charge), so the charges cancel. Remove an electron and the atom becomes positively charged, since it now has more protons than electrons; this is called a cation. Add an electron and the atom becomes negatively charged, an anion, since electrons now outnumber protons. The number of protons never changes during ionization — that would make it a different element entirely — only the electron count shifts.

Consider sodium (Na), which has 11 protons and, in its neutral state, 11 electrons. Sodium readily loses its single outermost electron to achieve a stable, filled-shell configuration like neon. It becomes Na⁺, with 11 protons and only 10 electrons, giving a net charge of +1. Chlorine (Cl), with 17 protons and 17 electrons, tends to gain one electron to fill its outer shell like argon, becoming Cl⁻, with 17 protons and 18 electrons, a net charge of −1. These two ions attract each other electrostatically and combine to form table salt, NaCl — a compound held together by an ionic bond, which is fundamentally the attraction between oppositely charged ions.

To predict whether an atom forms a cation or anion, and how many charges it carries, look at its position on the periodic table. Elements in Group 1 (like Na, K) lose one electron to form +1 ions; Group 2 elements (like Mg, Ca) lose two electrons to form +2 ions. Elements in Group 17 (like Cl, F) gain one electron to form −1 ions; Group 16 elements (like O, S) gain two electrons to form −2 ions. This pattern reflects each element's drive to reach a stable electron configuration, usually a filled outer shell of eight electrons (the octet rule).

**Problem-solving application**: Suppose you need to determine the charge and electron count of a calcium ion, Ca²⁺, given that neutral calcium has 20 protons and 20 electrons. Since the ion carries a +2 charge, it has 2 fewer electrons than protons: $20 - 2 = 18$ electrons, matching the stable configuration of argon. This same subtraction logic — protons minus net charge equals electron count — applies to any ion you encounter, whether predicting formulas for ionic compounds or balancing charges in a chemical equation.

---

## Anion

An anion is an atom or group of atoms that has gained one or more electrons, giving it a net negative electric charge. Because a neutral atom has equal numbers of protons and electrons, adding extra electrons unbalances that equality: the number of negatively charged electrons now exceeds the number of positively charged protons, and the particle as a whole carries a negative charge. Anions form most readily from atoms that already have a strong "pull" on electrons — typically nonmetals located toward the upper right of the periodic table, such as oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur — because these elements need only a few additional electrons to complete a stable outer electron shell.

**Worked example.** Consider a neutral chlorine atom, which has 17 protons and 17 electrons. Chlorine's outer shell holds 7 electrons but has room for 8, so the atom readily accepts one more electron from a nearby atom (often a metal) that is eager to lose one. After gaining that electron, chlorine has 17 protons but 18 electrons. The net charge is $(+17) + (-18) = -1$, so the resulting anion is written $\text{Cl}^-$, called chloride. The same logic applies to oxygen, which has 6 outer electrons and gains 2 to reach 8, forming the oxide anion $\text{O}^{2-}$.

**Problem-solving application.** Given an element's proton count and the number of electrons it has gained, you can always determine the ionic charge using the same balance: charge = (protons) − (electrons after gain). Try it: sulfur has 16 protons and gains 2 electrons to fill its outer shell. Its electron count becomes 18, so the charge is $(+16) - (+18) = -2$, giving the sulfide ion $\text{S}^{2-}$. This same reasoning explains why anions pair predictably with cations to form neutral compounds — table salt (NaCl) forms because the $\text{Na}^+$ cation's single positive charge exactly cancels the $\text{Cl}^-$ anion's single negative charge. Recognizing an anion's charge, then, is not just a labeling exercise; it is the key calculation behind predicting chemical formulas, balancing ionic equations, and understanding why certain elements combine in fixed, predictable ratios.

## Cation

A cation is an atom or group of atoms that carries a net positive electrical charge because it has lost one or more electrons relative to the number of protons in its nucleus. Since protons determine identity and charge while electrons are the particles that move during chemical change, losing electrons leaves the proton count unchanged but the electron count lower, producing an imbalance: more positive charge than negative. The name distinguishes this species from an anion, which carries a net negative charge from gaining electrons. Cations form because atoms and molecules tend toward electron configurations that are lower in energy, often resembling the stable arrangement of the nearest noble gas.

Consider sodium metal reacting with chlorine gas. A neutral sodium atom has 11 protons and 11 electrons. In the reaction, sodium transfers one electron to chlorine, leaving sodium with 11 protons but only 10 electrons. The resulting species, $\text{Na}^+$, has a net charge of $+1$ and an electron configuration identical to neon, a noble gas. Magnesium, needing to lose two electrons to reach a noble-gas configuration, forms $\text{Mg}^{2+}$. The superscript notation records both the sign and magnitude of the charge: the number indicates how many electrons were lost, and the plus sign indicates the resulting charge is positive.

Predicting cation charge is a practical skill built on periodic trends. Elements in Group 1 (alkali metals) reliably form $+1$ cations; Group 2 (alkaline earth metals) form $+2$ cations; aluminum in Group 13 forms $\text{Al}^{3+}$. A useful check is charge balance in a resulting compound: if you know that oxide ions are $\text{O}^{2-}$ and a metal M forms a neutral compound with formula $\text{M}_2\text{O}_3$, you can work backward. Since the two oxide ions contribute $2 \times (-2) = -4$ total charge, the two M cations must together contribute $+4$, so each M cation carries a charge of $+2$... but wait — check the subscripts: two M atoms and three O atoms means $2x + 3(-2) = 0$, giving $x = +3$. This algebraic balancing — total positive charge equals total negative charge in any neutral ionic compound — is the core problem-solving tool for determining unknown ionic charges, predicting formulas, and interpreting chemical names like "iron(III) chloride," where the Roman numeral explicitly states the cation's charge when an element forms more than one possible cation.

## Chemical Symbol

A chemical symbol is a one- or two-letter abbreviation that identifies a chemical element, standardized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Every symbol begins with a capital letter, and if a second letter is present, it is always lowercase — this capitalization rule exists specifically so that multi-symbol groups can be parsed unambiguously. For example, "Co" is cobalt (one element), while "CO" is carbon monoxide (carbon plus oxygen). Symbols derive from English names (H for hydrogen, O for oxygen) or from Latin or other historical names (Na for *natrium*, sodium; Fe for *ferrum*, iron; W for *wolfram*, tungsten), reflecting the discovery history of each element rather than any systematic pattern.

**Worked example.** Consider the label "NaCl" on a container. Applying the capitalization rule, you parse this as Na (one symbol, capital N + lowercase a) followed by Cl (capital C + lowercase l) — sodium and chlorine, the two elements in table salt. Contrast this with "CO2": here C stands alone as carbon, O stands alone as oxygen, and the subscript 2 indicates two oxygen atoms bonded to one carbon atom — carbon dioxide. If capitalization were ignored, "CO" could be misread as "Co" (cobalt), which is why the rule is enforced strictly.

**Problem-solving application.** Chemical symbols function as a compact code that lets you decompose any formula into its constituent elements, which is the first step in tasks like computing molar mass, balancing equations, or predicting reactivity from an element's position on the periodic table. Suppose you are given the formula for glucose, $\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6$, and asked to find its molar mass. You first parse the symbols — C, H, O — confirming three distinct elements, then look up each element's atomic mass (approximately 12.01, 1.01, and 16.00 g/mol respectively) and multiply by the subscript count before summing: $6(12.01) + 12(1.01) + 6(16.00) \approx 180.16$ g/mol. This same parsing skill scales to more complex formulas, such as distinguishing "CuSO4" (copper sulfate: Cu, S, O) from a formula containing "Co" — a common source of error for students who misread capitalization. In practice, fluency with chemical symbols is a prerequisite for nearly every quantitative task in chemistry, from stoichiometry to writing balanced reaction equations.

## Covalent Bond

A covalent bond forms when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons, with the shared pair(s) occupying the space between the nuclei and holding them together through mutual electrostatic attraction. This bonding strategy is favored by nonmetals, whose atoms have similarly high electronegativities — none is willing to fully surrender an electron to the other, so they compromise by sharing. Each shared pair counts as one bond; two pairs make a double bond, three make a triple bond. The number of bonds an atom forms is governed by the octet rule: atoms tend to share enough electrons to reach eight valence electrons (two, for hydrogen), matching the stable electron configuration of the nearest noble gas.

**Worked example.** Consider methane, $\text{CH}_4$. Carbon has four valence electrons and needs four more to reach an octet; each hydrogen has one valence electron and needs one more to reach two. Carbon forms four single bonds, one to each hydrogen, sharing one electron pair per bond. This satisfies carbon's octet (four bonding pairs = eight electrons around carbon) and each hydrogen's duet simultaneously. Now consider carbon dioxide, $\text{CO}_2$: oxygen needs two more electrons per atom, and carbon needs four more. A single bond to each oxygen would leave carbon two electrons short, so carbon instead forms a double bond with each oxygen — four shared electrons per bond, two bonds — giving carbon a full octet ($2+2+2+2=8$) and each oxygen a full octet as well.

**Problem-solving application.** Given only a molecular formula, you can predict the bonding pattern by counting total valence electrons and distributing them to satisfy every atom's octet (or duet, for hydrogen) with the fewest unshared "leftover" electrons possible. Try it with ammonia, $\text{NH}_3$: nitrogen contributes 5 valence electrons, each hydrogen contributes 1, for a total of 8. Three N–H single bonds use 6 electrons (3 pairs), leaving 2 electrons — one lone pair — on nitrogen, which completes its octet ($6 + 2 = 8$) without needing any double bonds. This electron-counting method — tally valence electrons, assign bonds to satisfy each atom's stable configuration, place remainders as lone pairs — works for predicting the structure of any small molecule built from period-2 nonmetals, and it is the same reasoning you will later extend to explain molecular shape and reactivity.

---

## Ionic Bond

An ionic bond is the electrostatic attraction that holds together oppositely charged ions in a compound. It forms when one atom transfers one or more electrons to another, typically a metal losing electrons to become a cation ($\text{X}^{n+}$) and a nonmetal gaining them to become an anion ($\text{Y}^{n-}$). The driving force is each atom's tendency to reach a stable, filled outer electron shell — usually the noble-gas configuration described by the octet rule. Unlike covalent bonds, where electrons are shared, ionic bonding involves complete electron transfer, and the resulting attraction is non-directional, extending in all directions and giving rise to a repeating crystal lattice rather than discrete molecules.

**Worked example.** Consider sodium chloride, $\text{NaCl}$. Sodium (electron configuration $[\text{Ne}]3s^1$) readily loses its single valence electron to form $\text{Na}^+$, which has the stable configuration of neon. Chlorine ($[\text{Ne}]3s^2 3p^5$) readily gains that electron to form $\text{Cl}^-$, achieving the configuration of argon. The transferred electron leaves sodium positively charged and makes chlorine negatively charged; the two ions then attract each other according to Coulomb's law, $F = k\dfrac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$, where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the ion charges and $r$ is the distance between them. Because this attraction is not confined to a single pair, each $\text{Na}^+$ ion surrounds itself with multiple $\text{Cl}^-$ neighbors and vice versa, producing the cubic lattice observed in table salt.

**Problem-solving application.** Given the empirical formula of an ionic compound, you should be able to predict its charge balance and structure. For example, magnesium oxide, $\text{MgO}$, forms from $\text{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\text{O}^{2-}$: two electrons transfer from magnesium to oxygen, and the 2:2 charge ratio requires only a 1:1 ion ratio for electrical neutrality. Contrast this with calcium chloride, $\text{CaCl}_2$, where $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ must pair with two $\text{Cl}^-$ ions to balance charge. This charge-balancing logic — matching total positive and negative charge to determine the subscript ratio — is the core skill for predicting formulas of ionic compounds from the periodic table alone, and it also explains macroscopic properties: because breaking a lattice requires disrupting many simultaneous ionic attractions, ionic compounds tend to have high melting points and conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as in a molten or dissolved state.

---

## Molecular Formula

A molecular formula specifies the exact number of each type of atom in a single molecule of a compound. Written as element symbols followed by subscript counts (e.g., $\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6$ for glucose), it is more informative than an empirical formula, which only gives the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms. Many different compounds can share the same empirical formula while having distinct molecular formulas — and distinct properties — because the actual atom count, and therefore the molecule's size and structure, differs.

**Worked example.** Suppose a compound has an empirical formula of $\text{CH}_2\text{O}$ (empirical molar mass $\approx 30.03\ \text{g/mol}$) and an experimentally determined molar mass of $180.16\ \text{g/mol}$. To find the molecular formula, divide the actual molar mass by the empirical formula mass:
$$
n = \frac{180.16}{30.03} \approx 6
$$
Multiplying every subscript in $\text{CH}_2\text{O}$ by $n=6$ gives $\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6$ — glucose. Formaldehyde is also built from $\text{CH}_2\text{O}$ units, yet it is chemically very different from glucose — exactly why the molecular formula, not just the ratio, matters for identifying a compound.

**Problem-solving application.** This is the standard method for identifying an unknown compound from lab data: one measurement gives you the empirical formula (from percent composition), and a separate measurement gives you the molar mass. Combine the two using the ratio above. As practice, try this: a compound is 40.0% carbon, 6.7% hydrogen, and 53.3% oxygen by mass, with a molar mass of $180\ \text{g/mol}$. First convert percentages to a mole ratio (assume 100 g of sample, divide each mass by its atomic mass, then divide through by the smallest value) to get the empirical formula, then apply the ratio method above to recover the molecular formula. You should arrive at the same glucose formula, $\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6$ — a useful check on your work, and a reminder that molecular formula determination always requires two independent pieces of data: composition and mass.

## Ionic Compound

An **ionic compound** forms when atoms transfer electrons rather than share them, producing oppositely charged ions that attract each other through electrostatic force. Metals, which hold their outermost electrons loosely, tend to lose electrons and become positively charged cations; nonmetals, which strongly attract electrons, gain them and become negatively charged anions. The resulting compound is electrically neutral overall: the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge. This attraction is not a localized bond between two atoms but an extended three-dimensional lattice, which is why ionic compounds form crystalline solids with high melting points rather than discrete molecules.

**Worked example.** Consider calcium and chlorine. Calcium (Ca) has two valence electrons and loses both to form $\text{Ca}^{2+}$. Chlorine (Cl) needs one electron to complete its outer shell and forms $\text{Cl}^-$. Since charges must balance, one $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ requires two $\text{Cl}^-$ ions: $2(-1) + (+2) = 0$. The formula is therefore $\text{CaCl}_2$, calcium chloride — not "CaCl" or "Ca$_2$Cl." This charge-balancing logic, not memorization, is what determines every ionic formula.

**Problem-solving application.** Given the charges of two ions, you can predict any ionic formula using the crisscross method: the numerical value of each ion's charge becomes the subscript of the other ion (reduced to lowest terms). For aluminum ($\text{Al}^{3+}$) and oxide ($\text{O}^{2-}$), crossing charges gives $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ — check: $2(+3) + 3(-2) = 6 - 6 = 0$. This method extends directly to real problems: predicting the formula of an unknown salt from known ion charges, balancing chemical equations that produce ionic products, or calculating the mass of a compound needed for a reaction using its molar mass (itself built from the correct formula). Try it yourself: what formula results from combining magnesium ($\text{Mg}^{2+}$) with phosphate ($\text{PO}_4^{3-}$)? Crossing charges gives $\text{Mg}_3(\text{PO}_4)_2$, and confirming $3(+2) + 2(-3) = 0$ verifies the answer. Mastering this balancing skill is the practical foundation for stoichiometry, solubility rules, and reaction prediction throughout introductory chemistry.

## Molecular Compound

A molecular compound forms when two or more nonmetal atoms share electrons through covalent bonds, creating discrete, electrically neutral units called molecules. Unlike ionic compounds, which form extended crystal lattices of alternating charged ions, molecular compounds exist as individual particles with a fixed, countable composition — one water molecule always contains exactly two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, written $\text{H}_2\text{O}$. Because the bonding is a matter of sharing rather than transferring electrons, these compounds are named using prefixes (mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and so on) that specify exactly how many atoms of each element are present, since two nonmetals can often combine in more than one ratio.

**Worked example.** Consider carbon and oxygen, which form two distinct molecular compounds: $\text{CO}$ and $\text{CO}_2$. Applying the naming convention, $\text{CO}$ is carbon monoxide (the "mono-" prefix on the first element is conventionally dropped, but retained on the second), while $\text{CO}_2$ is carbon dioxide. These are chemically and physically distinct substances — carbon monoxide is a toxic gas that binds hemoglobin, while carbon dioxide is a stable respiratory byproduct — despite containing the same two elements. This illustrates why molecular nomenclature must specify atom count explicitly: the formula alone determines identity, not just the elements involved.

**Problem-solving application.** Given the name "dinitrogen pentoxide," construct the formula. The prefixes "di-" and "penta-" indicate two nitrogen atoms and five oxygen atoms, giving $\text{N}_2\text{O}_5$. This compound is a real solid used in nitration chemistry, decomposing as $2\,\text{N}_2\text{O}_5 \rightarrow 4\,\text{NO}_2 + \text{O}_2$. Practicing this translation — name to formula, and formula to name — is the core skill for reading molecular compounds: identify the two element roots, convert each prefix to a subscript, and check that the resulting formula matches a chemically reasonable, neutral molecule. This same skill underlies interpreting reaction equations, computing molar masses, and predicting products in later stoichiometry problems.

## Polyatomic Ion

A polyatomic ion is a charged particle made of two or more atoms bonded together covalently, carrying a net electric charge because the total number of protons in the group no longer equals the total number of electrons. Unlike a simple ion such as $\text{Cl}^-$ or $\text{Na}^+$, a polyatomic ion behaves as a single unit in chemical reactions and in the formulas of ionic compounds — the covalent bonds holding it together do not break during typical ionic reactions, even though the ionic bonds connecting it to a counter-ion do. Common examples include the nitrate ion $\text{NO}_3^-$, the sulfate ion $\text{SO}_4^{2-}$, the ammonium ion $\text{NH}_4^+$, and the phosphate ion $\text{PO}_4^{3-}$.

**Worked example.** Consider calcium nitrate. Calcium forms a $2+$ cation ($\text{Ca}^{2+}$), and nitrate is a $1-$ anion ($\text{NO}_3^-$). Because charges must balance to zero in a neutral compound, one $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ requires two $\text{NO}_3^-$ ions: $\text{Ca}^{2+} + 2\,\text{NO}_3^- \rightarrow \text{Ca(NO}_3)_2$. Note the parentheses around $\text{NO}_3$ with the subscript $2$ outside — this notation signals that the entire polyatomic group is duplicated, not just one atom within it. Writing $\text{CaNO}_{32}$ instead would be incorrect and would misrepresent the actual atomic composition.

**Problem-solving application.** The practical skill here is predicting formulas and names from charge data, which chemists use constantly when writing reactions or interpreting labels. Suppose you are given aluminum ($\text{Al}^{3+}$) and sulfate ($\text{SO}_4^{2-}$) and asked for the neutral compound. Find the least common multiple of the charge magnitudes, 3 and 2, which is 6. You need 2 aluminum ions ($2 \times 3 = 6$) and 3 sulfate ions ($3 \times 2 = 6$), giving $\text{Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3$. This cross-multiplication trick — swapping the numerical charge of each ion to become the subscript of the other — works reliably whenever the two charges don't share a common factor with the smaller charge; when they do, simplify the ratio first (e.g., $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ with $\text{CO}_3^{2-}$ simplifies to a 1:1 ratio, $\text{CaCO}_3$, not $\text{Ca}_2(\text{CO}_3)_2$). Mastering this balancing procedure is essential for naming compounds correctly and for predicting products in double-replacement reactions involving polyatomic ions.

## Chemical Nomenclature

Chemical nomenclature is the systematic set of rules for naming chemical compounds so that any chemist, anywhere, can convert a name into an exact molecular structure — and vice versa — without ambiguity. This matters because a compound often has multiple common names but only one systematic (IUPAC) name. "Baking soda," "bicarbonate of soda," and "sodium hydrogen carbonate" all refer to the same substance, $\text{NaHCO}_3$, but only the last is unambiguous across languages and contexts.

The rules differ by compound class. For ionic compounds, name the cation first, then the anion, adjusting for variable charges on transition metals with Roman numerals: $\text{FeCl}_2$ is iron(II) chloride, while $\text{FeCl}_3$ is iron(III) chloride, because iron can exist as $\text{Fe}^{2+}$ or $\text{Fe}^{3+}$. For polyatomic ions, memorized names apply: $\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ is sulfate, $\text{SO}_3^{2-}$ is sulfite (fewer oxygens, "-ite" suffix). For covalent (molecular) compounds between two nonmetals, Greek prefixes indicate atom counts: $\text{CO}_2$ is carbon dioxide, $\text{N}_2\text{O}_4$ is dinitrogen tetroxide.

**Worked example**: Name $\text{Cu(NO}_3)_2$. First, identify the cation and anion: $\text{Cu}^{2+}$ (copper) and $\text{NO}_3^-$ (nitrate, a polyatomic ion). Since copper forms both $\text{Cu}^+$ and $\text{Cu}^{2+}$, the charge must be specified. Two nitrate ions ($\text{NO}_3^-$, charge $-1$ each) balance one copper ion, so the copper's charge is $+2$. The name is copper(II) nitrate.

**Problem-solving application**: Nomenclature rules let you reconstruct a formula from a name, which is essential in lab work, safety documentation, and reading scientific literature. Given "iron(III) sulfate," you know iron is $\text{Fe}^{3+}$ and sulfate is $\text{SO}_4^{2-}$. To balance charge, find the least common multiple of 3 and 2, which is 6: two $\text{Fe}^{3+}$ ions ($+6$ total) balance three $\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ ions ($-6$ total), giving $\text{Fe}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3$. This charge-balancing procedure — treat it as solving $3x = 2y$ for the smallest whole-number pair $(x, y)$ — works for any ionic compound and is the practical skill nomenclature problems actually test: not memorization, but systematic reconstruction of structure from name and charge.

## Payoff

Chemical nomenclature is the discipline of naming compounds so that a name and a structure determine each other without ambiguity. Given the name "iron(III) sulfate," a chemist can write the formula $\text{Fe}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3$ without ever seeing a sample; given the formula, they can generate the name. This bidirectional mapping is why nomenclature is the natural endpoint of this book: every earlier concept — atomic structure, ionic and covalent bonding, oxidation states, polyatomic ions, stoichiometry — was necessary groundwork for building a naming system, but naming is what makes those concepts *usable* as a shared language. A theory of bonding that cannot be communicated precisely is scientifically inert; nomenclature is the interface that turns structural knowledge into something transferable across labs, languages, and centuries of literature.

This payoff radiates outward into every domain that depends on unambiguous chemical communication. In pharmacology, a drug's systematic name (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid rather than "aspirin") pins down its exact molecular structure, which is what regulatory bodies, pharmacists, and researchers rely on to avoid the fatal ambiguity of trade names or shorthand. In environmental science, correctly naming pollutants — distinguishing nitrogen dioxide ($\text{NO}_2$) from dinitrogen tetroxide ($\text{N}_2\text{O}_4$) — determines which toxicity data and regulations apply, since these are chemically distinct species with different behaviors despite similar composition. In materials science, naming conventions for coordination compounds and polymers (e.g., poly(ethylene terephthalate)) encode structural information that predicts properties like melting point and reactivity, guiding synthesis decisions. In law and industry, chemical names appear in patents, safety data sheets, and international shipping regulations, where a naming error can mean a patent claim fails to cover the intended compound or a hazardous material is mislabeled. Even in computing, the rise of machine-readable chemical notations like SMILES and InChI descends directly from the same goal nomenclature pursues by hand: a lossless, unambiguous encoding of structure as text, now essential to cheminformatics and drug-discovery databases.

Nomenclature is thus not a memorization exercise appended to chemistry — it is the protocol that lets chemistry function as a cumulative, cross-disciplinary science. From here, the richest next step is to explore how this naming protocol was formalized into machine-readable strings: investigate SMILES notation and see how the same logic that names iron(III) sulfate now lets software search millions of molecules for a match to a target drug.

## Chemical Equation

A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction, showing the substances that react (reactants) and the substances produced (products), connected by an arrow indicating the direction of change. Reactants appear on the left, products on the right, and each substance is written using its chemical formula. A balanced chemical equation additionally satisfies the law of conservation of mass: the number of atoms of each element must be identical on both sides, since atoms are neither created nor destroyed in an ordinary chemical reaction — they are only rearranged.

**Worked example.** Consider the combustion of methane:

$$\text{CH}_4 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

Count atoms on each side: left has 1 C, 4 H, 2 O; right has 1 C, 2 H, 3 O. Carbon is balanced, but hydrogen and oxygen are not. To balance hydrogen, place a coefficient of 2 in front of $\text{H}_2\text{O}$:

$$\text{CH}_4 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\,\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

Now hydrogen is balanced (4 = 4), but oxygen on the right totals $2 + 2 = 4$, while the left still has only 2. Adjust the coefficient of $\text{O}_2$ to 2:

$$\text{CH}_4 + 2\,\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\,\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

Checking all elements: C (1=1), H (4=4), O (4=4). The equation is balanced.

**Problem-solving application.** Balancing an equation is really just adjusting coefficients, one element at a time, until the atom counts match on both sides — start with whichever element appears in the fewest substances, and save an element like oxygen for last if it shows up in several places. This matters practically because balanced equations are what allow stoichiometric calculations — determining how much product forms from a given amount of reactant, or how much reactant is needed to consume a fixed amount of another. For example, from the balanced methane equation above, a chemist immediately knows that burning 1 mole of methane requires exactly 2 moles of oxygen and yields 1 mole of carbon dioxide plus 2 moles of water. Try balancing $\text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$ (propane combustion) on your own: balance carbon first, then hydrogen, then oxygen last, since oxygen often appears in multiple products and is easiest to adjust once everything else is fixed. The correct coefficients are 1, 5, 3, 4.

## Coefficient

A coefficient is the numerical (or symbolic) factor that multiplies a variable in a term. In the expression $7x$, the coefficient of $x$ is $7$; in $-3x^2y$, the coefficient of $x^2y$ is $-3$. A term with no visible coefficient, like $x$, has an implied coefficient of $1$, and $-x$ has coefficient $-1$. Coefficients can be integers, fractions, decimals, or even other variables (as in $ax + b$, where $a$ is the coefficient of $x$). What matters is that the coefficient scales the variable term — it tells you how much of that variable's "unit" you have.

**Worked example.** Consider the polynomial $4x^3 - 2x^2 + 9x - 5$. Reading term by term: the coefficient of $x^3$ is $4$, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $-2$, the coefficient of $x$ is $9$, and $-5$ is the constant term (not attached to any variable, so it isn't called a coefficient). Suppose you want to combine this with $x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 1$. Combining like terms means adding the coefficients of matching powers: $(4+1)x^3 + (-2+5)x^2 + (9-3)x + (-5+1) = 5x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x - 4$. The variable and its exponent never change — only the coefficients are added.

**Problem-solving application.** Coefficients become essential when you model real relationships. Suppose a rideshare fare is $F = 2.50 + 1.75m$, where $m$ is miles traveled. Here $1.75$ is the coefficient of $m$: it represents the marginal cost per mile, while $2.50$ is a fixed base fee (constant term, not a coefficient, since no variable multiplies it). If a new pricing policy doubles the per-mile rate, only the coefficient changes: $F = 2.50 + 3.50m$. This distinction — which number scales with the variable versus which is fixed — is exactly what lets you predict costs, compare pricing plans, or solve for break-even points. For instance, setting two fare formulas equal, $2.50 + 1.75m = 5.00 + 1.00m$, and solving gives $0.75m = 2.50$, so $m \approx 3.33$ miles — the distance at which the two plans cost the same. Recognizing coefficients correctly is the first step in reading, comparing, and manipulating any algebraic model of a real situation.

## Law Of Conservation Of Matter

Matter cannot be created or destroyed in an ordinary chemical or physical process — it can only be rearranged. In a chemical reaction, the atoms present in the reactants regroup into new combinations to form products, but the total number of atoms of each element, and therefore the total mass, stays the same before and after the reaction. This principle, established experimentally by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century through careful mass measurements of sealed reactions, is the foundation on which all chemical equation balancing rests.

**Worked example.** Consider the combustion of methane: $\text{CH}_4 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$. As written, this equation is unbalanced — the left side has 4 hydrogen atoms while the right has only 2, and the oxygen count doesn't match either. To satisfy conservation of matter, we adjust the whole-number multipliers placed in front of each formula (never the subscripts inside a formula, since changing those would turn one substance into a different one) until the atom counts match on both sides:
$$\text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$
Now count atoms: left side has 1 C, 4 H, and 4 O; right side has 1 C, 4 H (from $2\text{H}_2\text{O}$), and 4 O (2 from $\text{CO}_2$, 2 from $2\text{H}_2\text{O}$). The equation is balanced, and if you weighed the reactants and products in a closed system, the masses would be identical.

**Problem-solving application.** Conservation of matter turns balancing equations from guesswork into a systematic accounting problem: treat each element as a quantity that must sum to the same total on both sides, then find the smallest set of front-of-formula multipliers that satisfy every element at once. The same accounting also gives you a fast check on any reaction's mass numbers. Suppose you're told a reaction consumes 16 g of methane and 64 g of oxygen, and produces 44 g of $\text{CO}_2$ plus 36 g of water. Conservation of mass says the totals on each side must match: $16 + 64 = 44 + 36 = 80$ g. If the numbers don't add up, you know immediately that a measurement or calculation error has crept in — a quick sanity check that matters in real laboratory or industrial settings, from pharmaceutical synthesis to environmental emissions accounting.

## Balanced Equation

A chemical equation represents a reaction using formulas for reactants and products, but writing it correctly requires more than naming the substances involved. A **balanced equation** is one in which the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the arrow. This requirement follows directly from the law of conservation of mass: atoms are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction, only rearranged into new combinations. If an equation shows different atom counts on each side, it misrepresents what actually happens during the reaction.

Balancing is done by adjusting **coefficients**—the numbers placed in front of chemical formulas—never by changing subscripts within a formula, since altering a subscript changes the identity of the substance itself (for example, changing $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ to $\text{H}_2\text{O}_2$ turns water into hydrogen peroxide, a different compound entirely).

**Worked example.** Consider the combustion of methane:
$$\text{CH}_4 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$
Count atoms on each side: left has 1 C, 4 H, 2 O; right has 1 C, 2 H, 3 O. Carbon is already balanced. To fix hydrogen, place a coefficient of 2 in front of $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, giving 4 H on the right. Now oxygen: the right side has $2 + 2 = 4$ oxygen atoms, so place a coefficient of 2 in front of $\text{O}_2$:
$$\text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$
Checking: 1 C, 4 H, 4 O on each side. The equation is balanced.

**Problem-solving application.** A practical strategy is to balance elements in a deliberate order: balance carbon first, then hydrogen, then oxygen last, since oxygen often appears in multiple compounds and is easiest to adjust once everything else is fixed. When coefficients come out as fractions (common with diatomic oxygen), multiply every coefficient in the equation by the same whole number to clear the fraction.

Try balancing $\text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$ (propane combustion) using this same order. You should find 3 $\text{CO}_2$, 4 $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, and—after clearing a fraction—5 $\text{O}_2$. The same ordered approach—carbon, then hydrogen, then oxygen, then clear any fractions—works for balancing any combustion or synthesis reaction you encounter.

## Mole

A mole is a counting unit, just like a "dozen" means 12 of anything. One mole represents exactly $6.02214076 \times 10^{23}$ particles — a number called Avogadro's number ($N_A$). Chemists need a unit this large because atoms and molecules are extraordinarily small; a single drop of water contains trillions of molecules, so counting them individually is impossible. Instead, chemists count in "chemist dozens" — moles.

The mole connects two things that are otherwise hard to relate: the **number of particles** (atoms, molecules, or ions) and the **mass** you can actually weigh on a balance. This link works because each element has a molar mass, numerically equal to its atomic mass in grams per mole. For example, one mole of carbon-12 atoms has a mass of 12 grams. For a compound, you add the molar masses of its constituent atoms. Water, $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, has a molar mass of $2(1.008) + 16.00 = 18.02\ \text{g/mol}$.

**Worked example.** Suppose you want to know how many molecules are in 36.04 grams of water. First, convert mass to moles using molar mass as a conversion factor:
$$
36.04\ \text{g} \times \frac{1\ \text{mol}}{18.02\ \text{g}} = 2.000\ \text{mol}
$$
Then convert moles to number of molecules using Avogadro's number:
$$
2.000\ \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}\ \frac{\text{molecules}}{\text{mol}} = 1.204 \times 10^{24}\ \text{molecules}
$$
Notice the pattern: mass and particle count are never directly interconverted — moles act as the required intermediate step.

**Problem-solving application.** Moles are essential for predicting how much product a chemical reaction will yield, a skill called stoichiometry. Suppose a reaction consumes 2 moles of hydrogen gas for every 1 mole of oxygen gas to produce water ($2\text{H}_2 + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$). If a chemist has 4 moles of $\text{H}_2$, the mole ratio tells them exactly 2 moles of $\text{O}_2$ are needed and 4 moles of $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ will form — without ever weighing a single atom directly. This is why the mole is often called the "chemist's dozen": it turns invisible particle counts into measurable, predictable quantities on a lab bench.

## Molar Mass

The **molar mass** of a substance is the mass of one mole of its particles, expressed in grams per mole (g/mol). Since one mole always contains Avogadro's number of particles ($6.022 \times 10^{23}$), molar mass acts as a conversion bridge between the microscopic world of atoms and molecules and the macroscopic world of grams you can measure on a balance. Numerically, the molar mass of an element in g/mol equals its atomic mass in atomic mass units (amu), as read from the periodic table. For compounds, you add the molar masses of every atom in the formula, accounting for subscripts.

**Worked example.** Find the molar mass of glucose, $C_6H_{12}O_6$.

- Carbon: $6 \times 12.01 = 72.06$ g/mol
- Hydrogen: $12 \times 1.008 = 12.10$ g/mol
- Oxygen: $6 \times 16.00 = 96.00$ g/mol

Summing: $72.06 + 12.10 + 96.00 = 180.16$ g/mol. So one mole of glucose — $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ molecules — has a mass of 180.16 g.

**Problem-solving application.** Molar mass is the tool that lets you convert between mass and moles, which is essential for stoichiometry. Suppose a recipe calls for 0.250 mol of table salt, NaCl (molar mass $22.99 + 35.45 = 58.44$ g/mol). How many grams should you measure out?

$$
\text{mass} = \text{moles} \times \text{molar mass} = 0.250 \text{ mol} \times 58.44 \ \frac{\text{g}}{\text{mol}} = 14.61 \text{ g}
$$

The same relationship works in reverse: if you weigh out 10.0 g of NaCl and want to know how many moles that represents, rearrange the equation to solve for moles instead of mass:

$$
\text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{10.0 \text{ g}}{58.44 \ \text{g/mol}} = 0.171 \text{ mol}
$$

This single relationship — mass equals moles times molar mass, solved for whichever quantity is unknown — underlies nearly every quantitative chemistry calculation, from determining limiting reactants in a reaction to preparing a solution of precise concentration in a laboratory setting. Mastering molar mass calculations is therefore a prerequisite skill for the stoichiometric problem-solving that follows in later sections.

## Stoichiometry

Stoichiometry is the quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a chemical reaction, based on the conservation of mass and the fixed ratios encoded in a balanced chemical equation. A balanced equation tells you not just what substances react, but exactly how many moles of each are involved. Because atoms are neither created nor destroyed in ordinary chemical reactions, the mole ratios in a balanced equation act like a conversion recipe: they let you predict how much product forms from a given amount of reactant, or how much reactant you need to make a target amount of product.

**Worked example.** Consider the combustion of propane:
$$
\text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + 5\,\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 3\,\text{CO}_2 + 4\,\text{H}_2\text{O}
$$
Suppose you burn 22 grams of propane ($M = 44.1\ \text{g/mol}$) completely. First convert mass to moles:
$$
n_{\text{C}_3\text{H}_8} = \frac{22\ \text{g}}{44.1\ \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.499\ \text{mol}
$$
The balanced equation shows a 1:3 ratio between propane and $\text{CO}_2$, so:
$$
n_{\text{CO}_2} = 0.499\ \text{mol} \times 3 \approx 1.497\ \text{mol}
$$
Converting back to mass using $M_{\text{CO}_2} = 44.0\ \text{g/mol}$ gives about 65.9 grams of carbon dioxide produced.

**Problem-solving application.** Real laboratory and industrial calculations rarely involve one reactant alone — you must identify the *limiting reactant*, the substance that runs out first and therefore caps how much product can form. Rather than introducing a new formula, apply the same three-step conversion from the worked example to each reactant in turn: convert its given mass to moles, then use the balanced equation's coefficients to see how far it could carry the reaction. Concretely, divide each reactant's mole amount by its own coefficient in the equation; whichever result is smallest is limiting, and all product calculations must be based on it, not on whichever reactant happens to be present in greater mass. For example, if you mix 10 g of propane with 20 g of oxygen, converting both to moles and dividing by their coefficients (1 and 5) reveals that oxygen — not propane — is exhausted first, so the actual $\text{CO}_2$ yield is smaller than the propane-only calculation would suggest. This limiting-reactant analysis underlies practical tasks such as optimizing reagent purchases, minimizing chemical waste, and scaling a reaction from a test tube to an industrial batch, where reactant costs and yields must be balanced precisely.

## Gravimetric Analysis

Gravimetric analysis is a quantitative chemistry technique that determines the amount of a substance in a sample by converting it into a pure, stable solid of known composition, then measuring that solid's mass. The logic is simple: if you can isolate all of a target ion or compound in a precisely weighable form, you can work backward through stoichiometry to find how much of it was originally present. The method hinges on precise mass measurement rather than volume, color change, or instrument calibration, which makes it one of the most accurate techniques available when executed carefully.

**Worked example.** Suppose a chemist wants to determine the percentage of chloride ion in an unknown sample. A measured mass of sample is dissolved, and excess silver nitrate ($\text{AgNO}_3$) is added, precipitating silver chloride:
$$\text{Ag}^+(aq) + \text{Cl}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgCl}(s)$$
The AgCl precipitate is filtered, washed to remove impurities, dried to constant mass, and weighed. If 0.250 g of sample yields 0.430 g of dried AgCl, the moles of AgCl (molar mass 143.32 g/mol) equal $0.430 / 143.32 = 3.00 \times 10^{-3}$ mol. Since the stoichiometric ratio of Cl⁻ to AgCl is 1:1, moles of Cl⁻ = $3.00 \times 10^{-3}$ mol, giving a mass of chloride of $3.00 \times 10^{-3} \times 35.45 = 0.1064$ g. The percent chloride in the original sample is then $(0.1064 / 0.250) \times 100\% = 42.5\%$.

**Problem-solving application.** The core skill is converting between measured mass, moles (via molar mass), and the stoichiometric ratio connecting the precipitate to the analyte of interest — the same three-step path used above to move from grams of AgCl to percent chloride by mass. Getting a trustworthy result from that calculation, however, depends on the quality of the precipitate itself. A student must ensure the precipitating reagent is added in excess (to drive the reaction to completion), that the precipitate is washed enough to remove soluble contaminants but not so much that some product dissolves and is lost, and that drying is continued until the mass stabilizes — confirming all moisture and volatile byproducts have been removed. Each of these checks exists to protect the same underlying mass-to-mole conversion from error: excess reagent guarantees the analyte is fully converted, proper washing keeps the measured mass free of extra solids, and drying to constant mass keeps it free of residual liquid. This technique remains essential in environmental testing, pharmaceutical quality control, and materials science whenever a reliable mass-based measurement is more trustworthy than other instrumental methods.

## Payoff

Gravimetric analysis is where the whole toolkit of quantitative chemistry converges: measuring mass, converting to moles, tracking stoichiometry, and reasoning about conservation. Its achievement is deceptively simple to state — determine the amount of a substance by carefully weighing it, or something derived from it, before and after a chemical transformation. But that simplicity is the point. Mass is the one quantity a chemist can measure with extraordinary precision using nothing more exotic than a balance, and every other quantitative technique in this book — molarity, limiting reagents, percent yield, empirical formulas — ultimately exists to convert a measured mass into chemical information, or to predict a mass from chemical information. Gravimetric analysis closes that loop: it is the technique where you stop calculating what a mass *should* be and start using a measured mass to find out what actually happened.

This is why it functions as the endpoint of the course rather than just another topic. Every earlier concept was preparing you to trust the number on the balance and reason backward from it: moles from mass, mass from moles, stoichiometric ratios from balanced equations, formulas from percent composition. Gravimetric analysis is the moment those threads become one procedure.

Its clearest application is combustion analysis, the classic method for determining the empirical formula of an organic compound. A sample is burned completely in excess oxygen, and every carbon atom becomes $\text{CO}_2$ while every hydrogen atom becomes $\text{H}_2\text{O}$. Both products are captured and weighed. From the mass of $\text{CO}_2$, you recover the mass of carbon originally present; from the mass of $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, the mass of hydrogen. If the compound also contains oxygen, its mass is found by difference from the original sample mass. These masses convert to moles, the mole ratios reduce to the empirical formula, and — if a molar mass is known — scale up to the molecular formula. The entire chain, from a few milligrams of unknown compound to a definite chemical formula, rests on nothing but careful weighing and the stoichiometric bookkeeping you have already mastered.

Where should you go next? Try working through a full combustion analysis problem yourself: given the masses of a burned hydrocarbon sample and its $\text{CO}_2$ and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ products, determine its empirical formula from scratch. That single exercise will show you, concretely, how every concept in this book was leading here.

## Oxidation

Oxidation is the loss of electrons by an atom, ion, or molecule during a chemical reaction. The term originated from reactions with oxygen, but the modern definition is broader: any species that loses electrons is oxidized, regardless of whether oxygen is involved. Oxidation always occurs together with reduction (electron gain) in what chemists call a redox reaction — electrons removed from one species must be accepted by another.

To track electron loss without drawing out every electron, chemists assign an **oxidation number** (or oxidation state) to each atom in a compound. This is a bookkeeping charge that an atom would have if all bonds were purely ionic. Rules include: elements in their natural form have an oxidation number of 0; oxygen is usually $-2$; hydrogen is usually $+1$; and the sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound equals 0 (or equals the ion's charge). When an atom's oxidation number increases, it has been oxidized.

**Worked example.** Consider the reaction:
$$
2\text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{MgO}
$$
In elemental magnesium, Mg has an oxidation number of 0. In MgO, magnesium is $+2$ and oxygen is $-2$. Magnesium's oxidation number rose from $0$ to $+2$, so magnesium was oxidized — it lost two electrons to oxygen. Oxygen's number fell from $0$ to $-2$, so oxygen was reduced.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given the reaction $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 2\text{Al} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + \text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ and asked to identify what is oxidized. Assign oxidation numbers: Al starts at 0 (elemental) and becomes $+3$ in $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ — an increase, so aluminum is oxidized. Iron starts at $+3$ in $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ and drops to 0 as elemental Fe — a decrease, so iron is reduced. This systematic approach — assign oxidation numbers before and after, then compare — works for identifying oxidation in any reaction, from rusting metal to combustion to the electron-transfer steps inside a battery, where the oxidized species is the one that ends up donating electrons at the anode.

## Oxidation Number

**Definition**

An oxidation number (or oxidation state) is a bookkeeping value assigned to an atom in a compound that represents the charge it would have if every bond were treated as fully ionic — that is, if all shared electrons were assigned to the more electronegative atom. It is not a real, measurable charge; it is an accounting convention that lets chemists track how electrons shift during a reaction. The rules are hierarchical: free elements are 0; monatomic ions equal their charge; oxygen is usually $-2$ (except peroxides, $-1$); hydrogen is usually $+1$ (except with metals, $-1$); fluorine is always $-1$; and the sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is 0, or equals the overall charge in a polyion.

**Worked example**

Find the oxidation number of manganese in $\text{KMnO}_4$. Potassium is a Group 1 metal, so it is $+1$. Oxygen follows its usual rule of $-2$, and there are four oxygens, contributing $-8$. Since the compound is neutral, the oxidation numbers must sum to zero:
$$(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0 \implies x = +7$$
So manganese is in the $+7$ oxidation state — a clue that $\text{KMnO}_4$ is a powerful oxidizing agent, since Mn(VII) can be reduced to lower, more stable states.

**Problem-solving application**

Oxidation numbers are most useful for identifying and balancing redox reactions, where tracking electron transfer by inspection is otherwise error-prone. Consider:
$$\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + \text{CO} \rightarrow \text{Fe} + \text{CO}_2$$
Assign oxidation numbers: Fe goes from $+3$ (in $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$) to $0$ (in Fe), a gain of 3 electrons per atom — reduction. Carbon goes from $+2$ (in CO) to $+4$ (in $\text{CO}_2$), a loss of 2 electrons — oxidation. To balance electrons lost and gained, you need 3 CO molecules (losing $3 \times 2 = 6$ electrons) for every 2 Fe atoms (gaining $2 \times 3 = 6$ electrons), giving the balanced equation $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 3\text{CO} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + 3\text{CO}_2$. This same technique — assign oxidation numbers, find what changes, match electrons transferred — is the standard first step for balancing any redox equation, including the more complex half-reaction method used in electrochemistry and titration problems.

## Reduction

**Reduction** is the process of showing that one problem can be solved by transforming it into another problem you already know how to solve. Instead of designing a new algorithm from scratch, you write a procedure that converts any instance of Problem A into an instance of Problem B, solves it using an existing method for B, and then converts the answer back. Reduction is the workhorse of computer science and mathematics: it is how new problems get connected to a shared toolbox of known solutions, and it is also the primary technique for proving that a problem is *hard* — if a known-hard problem reduces to yours, yours is at least as hard.

**Worked example.** Suppose you need to find the *maximum* value in a list, but you only have a working function `find_min(list)` that returns the minimum. Rather than writing a new search routine, negate every number in the list, run `find_min` on the negated list, and negate the result again:

```python
def find_max(nums):
    negated = [-x for x in nums]
    return -find_min(negated)
```

This is a genuine reduction: "find the max" has been transformed into "find the min," with a cheap conversion step (negation) on both ends. The correctness of `find_max` now rests entirely on the correctness of `find_min` — you don't need to reprove anything about searching.

**Problem-solving application.** Reductions are especially powerful for classifying problem difficulty. In computer science, a problem $P$ is shown to be NP-hard by taking a problem already known to be NP-hard, such as Boolean satisfiability (SAT), and constructing a polynomial-time transformation from SAT into $P$. If such a reduction exists, then any efficient algorithm for $P$ would also give an efficient algorithm for SAT — so $P$ inherits SAT's difficulty. This is why, when you encounter an unfamiliar optimization problem (say, scheduling jobs on machines to minimize delay), a productive first move is to ask: does this look like a disguised version of a problem I already know, such as bin-packing or the traveling salesman problem? If you can build a mapping between the two, you immediately gain access to decades of existing algorithms, complexity results, and heuristics — turning an unsolved problem into a solved one in translation.

## Electric Charge

Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that determines how a particle experiences and produces electromagnetic forces. Charge comes in two types, arbitrarily labeled positive and negative, and every observed charge is an integer multiple of the elementary charge $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{C}$. Protons carry charge $+e$, electrons carry $-e$, and neutrons carry none. Charge is conserved: in any isolated system, the total charge before an interaction equals the total charge after it. Like charges repel, opposite charges attract, and the strength of the interaction between two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by distance $r$ is given by Coulomb's law,

$$F = k_e \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}, \qquad k_e = 8.99 \times 10^9\ \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2.$$

This inverse-square dependence is essential: it is not a stylistic choice but the mathematical statement that the force falls off as the field from a point charge spreads over a sphere of area $4\pi r^2$.

**Worked example.** Two small spheres, each carrying $2.0\ \mu\text{C}$, sit $0.30\ \text{m}$ apart in air. The force between them is

$$F = (8.99\times10^9)\frac{(2.0\times10^{-6})^2}{(0.30)^2} \approx 0.40\ \text{N}.$$

Since both charges are positive, the force is repulsive, directed along the line joining the spheres.

**Problem-solving application.** Coulomb's law becomes a design tool once several charges act on one object at the same time, because each pairwise force still points along the line between the two charges involved, and the net force is just the sum of these individual forces. Suppose a $+3\ \mu\text{C}$ charge sits at the origin and a $-3\ \mu\text{C}$ charge sits $0.20\ \text{m}$ to its right. A third, positive test charge placed further to the right is pulled left toward the negative charge and pushed left away from the positive charge, so both forces point the same direction and simply add — no cancellation is possible on that side. If the test charge is instead placed between the two fixed charges, the pull toward the negative charge and the push away from the positive charge act in opposite directions, and setting the two Coulomb-law expressions equal, $F_1 = F_2$, gives an equation that can be solved for the position where the net force is zero. This same bookkeeping — computing each pairwise force from Coulomb's law and combining the results — is what underlies the design of electrostatic sensors, ion traps, and models of how nearby charges influence a chosen point in a circuit or material.

## Redox Reaction

A redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction is any chemical process in which electrons transfer between species, causing changes in oxidation states. Oxidation is the loss of electrons (oxidation number increases); reduction is the gain of electrons (oxidation number decreases). These two processes always occur together — one substance cannot lose electrons unless another accepts them. The substance that loses electrons is the reducing agent (it reduces the other species while being oxidized itself); the substance that gains electrons is the oxidizing agent.

**Worked example.** Consider the reaction between zinc metal and copper(II) sulfate solution:
$$\text{Zn}(s) + \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + \text{Cu}(s)$$

Assign oxidation states: zinc goes from $0$ to $+2$, losing two electrons (oxidation). Copper goes from $+2$ to $0$, gaining two electrons (reduction). Zinc is the reducing agent; $\text{Cu}^{2+}$ is the oxidizing agent. We can split this into two half-reactions, which must balance in electrons transferred:
$$\text{Zn} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^- \quad \text{(oxidation)}$$
$$\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu} \quad \text{(reduction)}$$
Adding them cancels the $2e^-$ on each side, confirming charge and mass balance — the core check for any redox equation.

**Problem-solving application.** The half-reaction method is the general tool for balancing redox equations, especially in acidic or basic solution where oxygen and hydrogen must also balance. Steps: (1) split into oxidation and reduction half-reactions; (2) balance atoms other than O and H; (3) balance O using $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, then H using $\text{H}^+$ (add $\text{OH}^-$ on both sides afterward if the reaction is basic); (4) balance charge with electrons; (5) multiply each half-reaction so electron counts match, then add and simplify.

This procedure isn't just bookkeeping — it's the basis for predicting whether a reaction will proceed spontaneously (via standard reduction potentials), designing batteries and electrolytic cells, understanding corrosion, and analyzing biological electron-transport chains. Any time you see a change in oxidation number — combustion, rusting, photosynthesis, respiration — you are looking at a redox process, and the half-reaction toolkit is how you quantify it.

## Electrochemical Cell

An electrochemical cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy (or vice versa) by physically separating an oxidation reaction from a reduction reaction, forcing electrons to travel through an external wire rather than transferring directly between reacting species. Every electrochemical cell has two electrodes: the **anode**, where oxidation occurs (electrons are released), and the **cathode**, where reduction occurs (electrons are consumed). A salt bridge or porous membrane completes the internal circuit by allowing ions to migrate, which keeps each half-cell electrically neutral as electrons flow externally.

**Worked example.** Consider the classic zinc-copper cell: a zinc electrode in $\text{ZnSO}_4$ solution connected to a copper electrode in $\text{CuSO}_4$ solution. Zinc is more easily oxidized than copper, so at the anode:
$$\text{Zn}(s) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^-$$
At the cathode, copper ions are reduced:
$$\text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu}(s)$$
The overall reaction, $\text{Zn}(s) + \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + \text{Cu}(s)$, is spontaneous, and the electrons released at the zinc anode travel through the external wire to the copper cathode, producing a measurable voltage — about 1.10 V under standard conditions. This voltage comes from the difference in each metal's tendency to lose electrons, quantified by standard reduction potentials $E^\circ$.

**Problem-solving application.** To predict whether a proposed cell will generate a voltage — and how much — engineers and chemists use tabulated standard reduction potentials. The cell potential is:
$$E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}}$$
where both values are taken as reduction potentials from a reference table, and the electrode with the higher (more positive) reduction potential automatically becomes the cathode. For example, given $E^\circ(\text{Cu}^{2+}/\text{Cu}) = +0.34\text{ V}$ and $E^\circ(\text{Zn}^{2+}/\text{Zn}) = -0.76\text{ V}$, copper is assigned as the cathode: $E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = 0.34 - (-0.76) = 1.10\text{ V}$, matching the experimental result. This same reasoning underlies practical decisions — choosing electrode materials for batteries, diagnosing why a metal corrodes when paired with another (galvanic corrosion), or designing electroplating and electrolysis setups where an external power source reverses the spontaneous direction.

## Electrolytic Cell

An electrolytic cell is a device that uses electrical energy to force a non-spontaneous chemical reaction to occur. This is the reverse relationship of a galvanic (voltaic) cell, which generates electrical energy from a spontaneous redox reaction. In an electrolytic cell, an external power source — a battery or rectifier — pushes electrons through the circuit, driving oxidation at the anode and reduction at the cathode even though the reaction would not proceed on its own. The process of using electricity to drive such a reaction is called electrolysis.

Structurally, an electrolytic cell looks similar to a galvanic cell: two electrodes immersed in an electrolyte, connected by an external circuit. The key difference is the polarity assignment. Because an outside power source controls electron flow, the anode in an electrolytic cell is connected to the positive terminal of the source (making it where oxidation occurs, as electrons are pulled away), and the cathode is connected to the negative terminal (where reduction occurs, as electrons are pushed in). This is the opposite polarity convention from a galvanic cell, even though "oxidation at the anode, reduction at the cathode" still holds in both.

Consider the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, used industrially to produce sodium metal and chlorine gas. Left alone, $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$ ions are stable and will not spontaneously convert back to elemental sodium and chlorine — that reverse reaction requires energy input. By applying a voltage across electrodes in molten NaCl, electrons are forced onto the cathode, reducing $\text{Na}^+$ to $\text{Na}(l)$, while at the anode, $\text{Cl}^-$ ions are oxidized to $\text{Cl}_2(g)$. The minimum voltage needed is determined by the cell's non-spontaneous nature: it must exceed the reverse of the spontaneous cell potential, meaning the applied voltage must overcome a negative cell potential to push the reaction forward.

In practice, engineers apply this to problems like electroplating, refining aluminum from bauxite (the Hall-Héroult process), and charging rechargeable batteries. When solving quantitative problems, chemists use Faraday's laws to relate the quantity of charge passed to the mass of substance produced: $m = \dfrac{Q \cdot M}{n \cdot F}$, where $Q$ is total charge in coulombs, $M$ is molar mass, $n$ is moles of electrons per mole of product, and $F$ is Faraday's constant ($96{,}485\ \text{C/mol}$). This lets one calculate, for example, how long a given current must run to deposit a specific mass of copper onto an object during electroplating — a direct, practical application of the cell's operating principle.

## Cathode

A cathode is the electrode at which reduction occurs — the site where a chemical species gains electrons. This definition holds regardless of whether you're looking at a battery, an electrolytic cell, a vacuum tube, or a diode, but the *polarity* of the cathode depends on whether the device is generating electrical energy (a galvanic cell, like a battery discharging) or consuming it (an electrolytic cell, like recharging a battery or electroplating metal). In a galvanic cell, the cathode is the positive terminal; in an electrolytic cell, it's the negative terminal. Students often try to memorize "cathode = positive" as a universal rule, which works for batteries in use but fails for electrolysis — the reliable anchor is always "reduction happens at the cathode," summarized by the mnemonic *"the cat gains"* (cathode = reduction = gain of electrons).

**Worked example.** Consider a standard alkaline battery (a galvanic cell) powering a flashlight. At the cathode, manganese dioxide is reduced: $\text{MnO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} + e^- \rightarrow \text{MnOOH} + \text{OH}^-$. Electrons flow from the anode (zinc, being oxidized) through the external circuit — the flashlight bulb — to the cathode, where this reduction consumes them. Because the cathode is where electrons arrive and are consumed, and the flashlight is in "discharge" mode, this cathode is the battery's positive terminal.

**Problem-solving application.** Now consider electroplating a spoon with silver. Here you're forcing a non-spontaneous reaction using an external power source (electrolytic cell), so the polarity flips relative to a battery in use. To plate silver onto the spoon, you must make the spoon the cathode, so that $\text{Ag}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \text{Ag}(s)$ deposits silver metal onto its surface. If you mistakenly wired the spoon as the anode instead, it would oxidize and dissolve rather than gain a coating. This is the practical test to apply in any electrochemical setup: identify which electrode you want reduction (deposition, gas evolution, or ion discharge) to occur at, and connect the external circuit so that electrode is the cathode — then check whether the cell's mode (spontaneous vs. driven) tells you its actual voltage sign.

## Electrolysis

Electrolysis is the process of using electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction — typically decomposing a compound into its elements or simpler substances. A direct current source is connected to two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) immersed in a molten or dissolved electrolyte. At the cathode, reduction occurs as electrons are supplied to positive ions (cations); at the anode, oxidation occurs as electrons are pulled away from negative ions (anions) or from the electrode material itself. Unlike a galvanic cell, which generates electricity spontaneously from a favorable reaction, electrolysis forces an unfavorable reaction to proceed by supplying external energy.

**Worked example.** Consider the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride (NaCl), a classic industrial process for producing sodium metal and chlorine gas. At the cathode, sodium ions gain electrons: $\text{Na}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \text{Na}(l)$. At the anode, chloride ions lose electrons: $2\text{Cl}^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2(g) + 2e^-$. Combining these half-reactions (balancing electrons) gives the overall reaction: $2\text{NaCl}(l) \rightarrow 2\text{Na}(l) + \text{Cl}_2(g)$.

The one new tool we need to quantify electrolysis is **Faraday's law**: the amount of product formed is proportional to the total electric charge passed through the cell. Charge is current multiplied by time ($Q = It$, in coulombs), and every 96,485 coulombs of charge corresponds to one mole of electrons — a quantity called Faraday's constant, $F$. So moles of electrons $= Q/F$.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a current of 5.0 A is passed through molten NaCl for 2 hours. Charge passed: $Q = It = (5.0\ \text{A})(7200\ \text{s}) = 36{,}000\ \text{C}$. Moles of electrons: $36{,}000 / 96{,}485 \approx 0.373\ \text{mol } e^-$.

Now apply the stoichiometry from the half-reactions above. One electron produces one atom of Na, so we get about 0.373 mol Na — roughly 8.6 g. Two electrons are needed per molecule of $\text{Cl}_2$, so we get half as many moles of gas: about 0.187 mol, or roughly 4.18 L at standard conditions.

This pattern — current and time give charge, charge and Faraday's constant give moles of electrons, and the balanced half-reactions convert that into moles of product — is the essential skill for solving any electrolysis problem, whether refining aluminum, electroplating metal, or producing hydrogen fuel by splitting water.

## Electroplating

Electroplating is the process of depositing a thin layer of metal onto a conductive surface using an electric current. It relies on electrolysis: when current passes through an electrolyte solution containing dissolved metal ions, those ions gain electrons at the cathode (the object being plated) and deposit as solid metal atoms. The object to be coated is made the cathode, a bar of the plating metal is made the anode, and both are submerged in an electrolyte solution containing ions of that metal — for example, copper sulfate solution for copper plating. As current flows, the anode dissolves into solution while metal ions deposit onto the cathode, building up a uniform coating.

**Worked example.** Suppose you want to silver-plate a brass ring using a silver nitrate solution ($\text{AgNO}_3$). You connect the ring to the negative terminal (cathode) and a silver rod to the positive terminal (anode) of a DC power supply, then submerge both in the solution. At the cathode, silver ions gain an electron and deposit as solid silver: $\text{Ag}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \text{Ag(s)}$. At the anode, silver atoms lose an electron and dissolve into solution, replenishing the ion supply: $\text{Ag(s)} \rightarrow \text{Ag}^+ + e^-$. The net effect is that silver migrates from the anode, through the solution, onto the cathode — the brass ring emerges coated in silver, while the anode slowly shrinks.

**Problem-solving application.** Electroplating is quantitatively controllable: the mass of metal deposited depends directly on the total charge passed, following Faraday's laws of electrolysis, $m = \dfrac{Q \cdot M}{n \cdot F}$, where $Q$ is charge in coulombs, $M$ is molar mass, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred per ion, and $F$ is Faraday's constant ($96{,}485\ \text{C/mol}$). This lets an engineer calculate plating time for a target coating thickness — a real industrial concern, since electroplating is used to prevent corrosion (zinc-plated steel), improve conductivity (gold-plated connectors), and add decorative finishes (chrome-plated fixtures). Consider designing a plating bath: if you know the desired mass of copper to deposit and the current your power supply can safely deliver, you can solve for the required plating time, $t = Q/I$. This connects an abstract electrochemical principle to a concrete manufacturing decision — how long a part must sit in the bath to meet a specification.

## Payoff

Electroplating is the culminating concept because it takes almost everything the course has built — electric current, redox chemistry, ion transport in solution, and circuit design — and turns it into a controllable, atom-by-atom manufacturing process. In electroplating, a workpiece is submerged in an electrolyte containing dissolved metal ions and connected as the cathode of a circuit; a separate electrode of the plating metal serves as the anode. When current flows, metal ions in solution gain electrons at the cathode and deposit as a solid layer on the workpiece, while the anode dissolves to replenish the ions consumed. The thickness of the deposited layer is governed by Faraday's laws of electrolysis: the mass deposited is proportional to the total charge passed, $m = \dfrac{Q \cdot M}{n \cdot F}$, where $Q$ is charge, $M$ is molar mass, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred per ion, and $F$ is Faraday's constant. This single equation lets an engineer dial in current and time to hit a target coating thickness with precision — turning chemistry into a design specification.

This is why electroplating sits at the end of the book: it is the point where charge, current, and chemical reactivity stop being separate topics and become one integrated tool for shaping matter. A steel bolt plated with zinc resists rust because the zinc corrodes preferentially, protecting the base metal — a direct application of the electrochemical series studied earlier. A printed circuit board's copper traces are built up by plating copper onto a patterned template, linking this concept to circuit fabrication. Decorative and protective finishes — gold on jewelry, chromium on fixtures — rely on the same current-controlled deposition to achieve durability and appearance simultaneously. Even metal recovery and recycling operations use a reverse logic of the same electrochemical cell to reclaim valuable metals from waste streams.

In each case, the underlying idea is identical: control the current, control the atoms. What changes is only the metal, the electrolyte, and the purpose — protection, conduction, appearance, or recovery.

Pick one of these applications — corrosion protection, circuit manufacturing, decorative finishing, or metal recovery — and work through how Faraday's law would be used to specify the plating current and time needed to achieve a real-world target thickness.

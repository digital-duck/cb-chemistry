## Matter

**Definition.** In classical physics, *matter* is any substance that possesses mass and occupies volume, thereby exhibiting inertia and interacting through gravitational and electromagnetic forces. Formally, a body of matter is characterized by a mass density function $\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$, defined so that the total mass in a region $V$ is

$$
m = \int_V \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)\, dV.
$$

Matter is distinguished from massless fields (such as electromagnetic radiation in vacuum) by satisfying $\rho > 0$ almost everywhere in its occupied domain, and by obeying conservation of mass, expressed locally via the continuity equation.

**Worked example.** Consider a thin rod of length $L$ with linear mass density $\lambda(x) = \lambda_0\left(1 + \dfrac{x}{L}\right)$ for $x \in [0, L]$. The total mass is

$$
m = \int_0^L \lambda_0\left(1 + \frac{x}{L}\right) dx = \lambda_0\left[x + \frac{x^2}{2L}\right]_0^L = \frac{3}{2}\lambda_0 L.
$$

This illustrates how the abstract definition of matter as mass-bearing substance reduces to an integral computation once a density function is specified.

**Key theorem (Conservation of Mass).** For a closed system with no mass flux across its boundary $\partial V$, the total mass is conserved:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\int_V \rho\, dV = -\oint_{\partial V} \rho\, \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{n}\, dA = 0,
$$

which follows from the divergence theorem applied to the continuity equation $\partial_t \rho + \nabla\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v}) = 0$.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

x, L, lam0 = sp.symbols('x L lambda_0', positive=True)
lam = lam0 * (1 + x/L)
mass = sp.integrate(lam, (x, 0, L))
print(sp.simplify(mass))  # 3*L*lambda_0/2

## States Of Matter

**Definition.** A *state of matter* (or *phase*) is a macroscopically homogeneous form of a physical system, characterized by a distinctive arrangement of constituent particles and a corresponding response to changes in energy, volume, and intermolecular forces. The three classical states—solid, liquid, and gas—are distinguished by the relative magnitude of the average kinetic energy of particles, $\langle E_k \rangle = \tfrac{3}{2}k_BT$, compared to the depth of the intermolecular potential well, $U_0$. When $\langle E_k \rangle \ll U_0$, particles are locked into a rigid lattice (solid); when $\langle E_k \rangle \approx U_0$, particles retain cohesion but move freely past one another (liquid); when $\langle E_k \rangle \gg U_0$, particles escape mutual attraction entirely (gas).

**Worked example.** Consider water at standard atmospheric pressure ($P = 1\,\text{atm}$). Its behavior as a function of temperature $T$ traces a path along the phase diagram: below $273.15\,\text{K}$ it is solid (ice), between $273.15\,\text{K}$ and $373.15\,\text{K}$ it is liquid, and above $373.15\,\text{K}$ it is gaseous (steam). At each transition, added heat $Q$ does not raise $T$ but instead performs the work of overcoming intermolecular bonds, quantified by the latent heat $L$ via $Q = mL$.

**Key theorem (Clausius–Clapeyron relation).** Along any coexistence curve between two phases, the equilibrium pressure and temperature satisfy
$$
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{L}{T\,\Delta V},
$$
where $L$ is the latent heat of transition and $\Delta V$ is the change in molar volume. This differential equation governs the shape of phase boundaries and predicts, for instance, why increased pressure lowers the melting point of ice.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

T, P, L, dV = sp.symbols('T P L dV', positive=True)
dPdT = L / (T * dV)
print("Clausius-Clapeyron slope dP/dT =", dPdT)

## Plasma

**Definition.** A plasma is a quasi-neutral gas of charged and neutral particles that exhibits collective behavior. Formally, a state of matter is called a plasma when the number density of free electrons and ions is sufficiently high that the Debye length,
$$
\lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}},
$$
is much smaller than the characteristic size $L$ of the system. Here $\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $k_B$ Boltzmann's constant, $T_e$ the electron temperature, $n_e$ the electron number density, and $e$ the elementary charge. The Debye length measures the distance over which an electric field from a charged particle is screened by surrounding mobile charges; the condition $\lambda_D \ll L$ ensures charge neutrality holds on macroscopic scales while microscopic electric fields still drive dynamics.

**Worked example.** Consider a laboratory plasma with $n_e = 10^{18}\ \text{m}^{-3}$ and $T_e = 2\ \text{eV}$ (so $k_B T_e = 2 \times 1.602\times10^{-19}\ \text{J}$). Substituting into the formula gives $\lambda_D \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-5}\ \text{m}$, about $33\ \mu\text{m}$. Since typical apparatus dimensions are on the order of centimeters, $\lambda_D \ll L$ is satisfied, confirming the medium behaves as a plasma rather than a collection of independent charges.

**Key theorem (quasi-neutrality).** If $\lambda_D \ll L$, then within any macroscopic volume $V$ with $V^{1/3} \gg \lambda_D$, the net charge density satisfies $\rho \approx 0$, i.e. $n_e \approx Z n_i$ for singly or multiply ionized species of charge $Z$. This follows from Poisson's equation combined with Boltzmann-distributed electron density in equilibrium; any local charge imbalance is exponentially screened over a length scale $\lambda_D$.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

n_e, T_e, eps0, kB, e = sp.symbols('n_e T_e epsilon_0 k_B e', positive=True)
lambda_D = sp.sqrt(eps0 * kB * T_e / (n_e * e**2))

values = {eps0: 8.854e-12, kB: 1.381e-23, e: 1.602e-19,
          T_e: 2 * 1.602e-19 / 1.381e-23, n_e: 1e18}
print(lambda_D.subs(values).evalf())  # Debye length in meters

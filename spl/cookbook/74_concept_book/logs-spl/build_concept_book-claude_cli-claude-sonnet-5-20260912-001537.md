## Covalent Bonding

A covalent bond forms when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons, allowing each atom to attain a more stable, lower-energy electron configuration—typically a full outer shell of eight electrons (the octet rule) or two electrons for hydrogen. Unlike ionic bonding, where electrons transfer completely from one atom to another, covalent bonding involves electrons occupying a shared region of space between the two nuclei. This shared electron pair is attracted simultaneously to both nuclei, and that mutual attraction is what holds the atoms together.

Consider the formation of a chlorine molecule, $\text{Cl}_2$. Each chlorine atom has seven valence electrons and needs one more to complete its octet. Neither atom can simply take an electron from the other, since both have the same electronegativity. Instead, each contributes one electron to a shared pair, so both atoms effectively "count" eight electrons around themselves. The result is a single covalent bond, written $\text{Cl-Cl}$.

When solving structural problems, the key skill is determining how many bonds and lone pairs a molecule needs. A reliable method is to count total valence electrons across all atoms, then distribute them to give every atom (except hydrogen) an octet, using shared pairs for bonds and remaining pairs as lone pairs on individual atoms. Applying this to $\text{Cl}_2$: two chlorine atoms contribute seven electrons each, for a total of fourteen. One pair (two electrons) forms the shared bond between the atoms, leaving twelve electrons—six on each chlorine—distributed as three lone pairs per atom. Checking the result, each chlorine atom is now surrounded by eight electrons: two from the shared bond and six from its own lone pairs, satisfying the octet rule and confirming the structure is correct.

This bookkeeping approach—counting electrons, then assigning bonds and lone pairs to satisfy each atom's stability requirement—generalizes directly to more complex molecules with multiple atoms, multiple bonds, or double and triple bonds, and is the practical foundation for predicting molecular structure, which in turn determines a molecule's shape, polarity, and reactivity in later topics such as VSEPR theory and intermolecular forces.

## Oxidation State

Oxidation state (also called oxidation number) is a bookkeeping value assigned to an atom in a compound that represents the charge it would have if all bonds were treated as completely ionic. It is not necessarily a real, measurable charge — it is a formal accounting tool that tracks how electrons are distributed among atoms, which makes it indispensable for identifying and balancing oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions.

To assign oxidation states, chemists follow a hierarchy of rules: free elements are 0; monatomic ions equal their charge; oxygen is usually $-2$ (except in peroxides, where it is $-1$); hydrogen is usually $+1$ (except with metals, where it is $-1$); fluorine is always $-1$; and the sum of oxidation states in a neutral compound must equal 0, or must equal the overall charge in a polyatomic ion.

**Worked example.** Find the oxidation state of manganese in permanganate, $\text{MnO}_4^-$. Oxygen contributes $4 \times (-2) = -8$. Since the ion's total charge is $-1$, manganese must satisfy:
$$
x + (-8) = -1 \implies x = +7
$$
So manganese is in the $+7$ oxidation state — its most oxidized common form.

**Problem-solving application.** Oxidation states let you spot redox reactions even when they're disguised in complex-looking equations, by tracking which atoms gain electrons (reduction, oxidation state decreases) and which lose them (oxidation, oxidation state increases). Consider the reaction:
$$
\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 3\text{CO} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + 3\text{CO}_2
$$
Assign oxidation states: iron goes from $+3$ (in $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$) to $0$ (elemental iron), so it is reduced. Carbon goes from $+2$ (in CO) to $+4$ (in $\text{CO}_2$), so it is oxidized. This confirms the reaction is a redox process even though no ions or obvious "electron transfer" are visible in the formulas. This same technique — comparing an atom's oxidation state on each side of an equation — is exactly how chemists balance complex redox reactions using the half-reaction method, and how they predict whether a proposed reaction is even chemically plausible before running it in the lab.

## Nitrogen Fixation

Nitrogen makes up 78% of Earth's atmosphere, yet most organisms cannot use it in its gaseous form, $N_2$. The two nitrogen atoms in $N_2$ are joined by a triple bond, one of the strongest bonds in chemistry, so breaking it apart requires either enormous amounts of energy or a highly specialized biological catalyst. Nitrogen fixation is the process of converting inert atmospheric $N_2$ into ammonia ($NH_3$) or related compounds that plants and other organisms can absorb and build into amino acids, nucleotides, and proteins. Without it, nitrogen would remain locked in the air, unusable, and life as we know it could not sustain itself.

Biological nitrogen fixation is carried out almost exclusively by certain bacteria and archaea, using an enzyme complex called nitrogenase. The best-known example is *Rhizobium*, a bacterium that lives in nodules on the roots of legumes such as beans, peas, and clover. Inside these nodules, *Rhizobium* fixes nitrogen in exchange for sugars supplied by the plant — a mutualistic relationship. The reaction, simplified, is:

$$N_2 + 8H^+ + 8e^- + 16\,ATP \rightarrow 2NH_3 + H_2 + 16\,ADP + 16\,P_i$$

Notice the steep energy cost: sixteen ATP molecules per reaction cycle. This is why nitrogen fixation is biologically expensive and why nitrogenase only operates in oxygen-poor environments — oxygen destroys the enzyme.

Consider a practical application: a farmer wants to improve soil fertility without relying entirely on synthetic fertilizer, which is manufactured industrially through the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process (which also converts $N_2$ to $NH_3$, but using high heat and pressure instead of enzymes). By rotating crops — planting soybeans or clover one season, then corn the next — the farmer allows legume-associated bacteria to enrich the soil with fixed nitrogen. This reduces fertilizer costs, limits nitrogen runoff into waterways (a major cause of algal blooms), and improves long-term soil health.

This comparison illustrates a broader problem-solving principle: when a process is metabolically or industrially costly, look for ways nature already solves it efficiently, and design systems — agricultural, chemical, or engineered — that work with those biological mechanisms rather than replacing them outright.

## Haber Process

The Haber process is an industrial method for synthesizing ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$) by reacting nitrogen gas from the air with hydrogen gas, using a catalyst and controlled conditions of temperature and pressure. The overall reaction is:

$$\text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3(g)$$

This reaction is reversible and exothermic, and it does not proceed at a useful rate under ordinary conditions — nitrogen's triple bond ($\text{N}\equiv\text{N}$) is extremely strong and resists breaking. Fritz Haber discovered in 1909 that an iron-based catalyst, combined with high pressure (150–300 atmospheres) and moderate-to-high temperature (400–500°C), makes the reaction commercially viable. Carl Bosch later scaled this into industrial practice, so the process is often called the Haber-Bosch process.

**Worked example.** Because the forward reaction is exothermic and reduces the number of gas molecules (4 moles of reactant gas → 2 moles of product gas), Le Chatelier's principle tells us two things: lowering temperature favors ammonia formation (equilibrium shifts to release less heat), but so does raising pressure (equilibrium shifts toward fewer gas molecules). Yet industrial plants don't run at very low temperatures, because reaction rate would become impractically slow — even with a catalyst. Engineers instead accept a compromise: moderate temperature (400–500°C) sacrifices some equilibrium yield in exchange for a workable reaction rate, and high pressure (150–300 atm) partially compensates by pushing yield back up. Unreacted $\text{N}_2$ and $\text{H}_2$ are recycled continuously, so even a modest per-pass conversion (typically 10–20%) becomes highly efficient overall.

**Problem-solving application.** This trade-off — rate versus equilibrium position — is a recurring theme in industrial chemistry and process engineering, not just this one reaction. When designing or evaluating any equilibrium-driven process, ask: (1) which direction does Le Chatelier's principle favor for the desired product? (2) what conditions maximize rate, and do they conflict with the equilibrium-favoring conditions? (3) can a catalyst decouple these by speeding up the reaction without shifting equilibrium? The Haber process is also foundational because synthetic ammonia underlies most nitrogen fertilizers, making it one of the few chemical reactions credited with reshaping global food production and population growth.

## Payoff

The Haber process is the concept toward which every prior idea in this book has been building, because it solves a problem that is simultaneously chemical, industrial, and civilizational: how to convert the inert nitrogen of the atmosphere into a form that living systems can use. Nitrogen gas, $\text{N}_2$, makes up 78% of the air we breathe, yet its triple bond is so strong that plants cannot access it directly. The Haber process breaks that bond by reacting nitrogen with hydrogen over an iron catalyst at high temperature and pressure,

$$\text{N}_2(g) + 3\,\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\,\text{NH}_3(g),$$

producing ammonia, the starting point for nearly all synthetic nitrogen fertilizer on Earth. It is the natural endpoint of this book because it draws together equilibrium (Le Chatelier's principle explains why high pressure and a catalyst are chosen), thermodynamics (the reaction is exothermic, forcing a temperature trade-off between rate and yield), and reaction engineering (the industrial reactor design reflects a genuine optimization problem, not just a chemical equation). Ammonia synthesis is estimated to sustain the nitrogen intake of roughly half the world's population — a single reaction, scaled correctly, reshaping global food supply.

This is also why the Haber process unlocks the Ostwald process rather than standing alone. Ammonia produced at scale is not only a fertilizer feedstock; it is also the raw material for oxidation into nitric acid. The Ostwald process takes the $\text{NH}_3$ that Haber makes available and oxidizes it catalytically over platinum-rhodium gauze, first to nitric oxide and then, through further oxidation and absorption in water, to $\text{HNO}_3$. Without an abundant, industrial-scale source of ammonia, the Ostwald process would be economically irrelevant; with it, nitric acid production becomes viable at the scale needed for fertilizers, explosives, and industrial chemistry. The two processes together form a two-stage pipeline: Haber fixes nitrogen from air, Ostwald converts the product into one of the most versatile acids in the chemical industry.

From here, the natural next step is to work through the Ostwald process in depth — its reaction mechanism, its catalyst choice, and the engineering decisions that let it inherit Haber's ammonia at industrial scale.

## Electron Configuration

**Definition.** An electron configuration is a shorthand notation describing how electrons are distributed among an atom's orbitals. Electrons fill orbitals according to three governing rules: the **Aufbau principle** (electrons occupy the lowest-energy orbitals available first), the **Pauli exclusion principle** (each orbital holds at most two electrons, with opposite spins), and **Hund's rule** (electrons fill degenerate orbitals — orbitals of equal energy, like the three $p$ orbitals — singly before pairing up). Orbitals are labeled by principal quantum number $n$ and subshell type ($s$, $p$, $d$, $f$), with maximum electron capacities of 2, 6, 10, and 14 respectively. The filling order follows increasing $(n + \ell)$, summarized by the diagonal rule: $1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, \dots$

**Worked example.** Consider iron, $Z = 26$. Filling orbitals in order and tracking the electron count: $1s^2$ (2), $2s^2$ (4), $2p^6$ (10), $3s^2$ (12), $3p^6$ (18), $4s^2$ (20), $3d^6$ (26). The full configuration is:
$$1s^2\,2s^2\,2p^6\,3s^2\,3p^6\,4s^2\,3d^6$$
Note that $4s$ fills before $3d$ despite $3d$ belonging to a lower principal shell — this is because $4s$ has lower energy in neutral atoms at this point in the periodic table. A common shorthand uses the previous noble gas as a core: $[\text{Ar}]\,4s^2 3d^6$.

**Problem-solving application.** Electron configurations let you predict chemical behavior directly from an atom's position on the periodic table, without memorizing individual elements. Two skills matter most in practice:

1. *Predicting reactivity and ion charge.* Atoms tend toward configurations that fill or empty their outermost (valence) subshell. Chlorine ($[\text{Ne}]3s^2 3p^5$) is one electron short of a filled $3p^6$ shell, so it readily gains an electron to form $\text{Cl}^-$. Magnesium ($[\text{Ne}]3s^2$) loses its two valence electrons to form $\text{Mg}^{2+}$, achieving the neon configuration.

2. *Handling exceptions.* Some transition metals deviate from the diagonal rule because half-filled or fully-filled $d$ subshells are unusually stable. Chromium is $[\text{Ar}]4s^1 3d^5$ rather than the "expected" $4s^2 3d^4$, since a half-filled $3d^5$ lowers overall energy through reduced electron-electron repulsion.

When solving configuration problems, always cross-check your electron count against $Z$, and for ions, remove or add electrons from the *outermost* shell first — even when that means removing $4s$ electrons before $3d$ electrons, since $3d$ becomes lower in energy than $4s$ once occupied.

## Ionization Energy

**Definition.** Ionization energy is the minimum energy required to remove one electron from an isolated gaseous atom, forming a positively charged ion:

$$X(g) + \text{energy} \rightarrow X^+(g) + e^-$$

Every element has a *first* ionization energy ($IE_1$, removing the outermost electron), a *second* ($IE_2$, removing an electron from the resulting cation), and so on. Because removing an electron from an already-positive ion requires overcoming stronger electrostatic attraction, ionization energies always increase within an atom: $IE_1 < IE_2 < IE_3 < \dots$

Ionization energy is governed by two competing factors: nuclear charge (more protons pull harder on electrons) and shielding/distance (electrons farther from the nucleus, or shielded by inner-shell electrons, are held less tightly). This produces the periodic trend: ionization energy generally increases across a period (left to right, as nuclear charge grows while shielding stays roughly constant) and decreases down a group (as electrons occupy shells farther from the nucleus).

**Worked example.** Compare sodium ($1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^1$) and magnesium ($1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2$). Sodium's $IE_1$ is about 496 kJ/mol; magnesium's is about 738 kJ/mol, consistent with magnesium's higher nuclear charge and similar shielding. But sodium's $IE_2$ jumps dramatically to about 4560 kJ/mol — nearly ten times $IE_1$ — because removing a second electron means breaking into the filled, tightly bound $2p^6$ core rather than the loosely held $3s$ valence electron.

**Problem-solving application.** A large jump between successive ionization energies is a diagnostic tool for identifying the number of valence electrons an element has, since core electrons are far more tightly bound than valence electrons. Given a set of ionization energies for an unknown element — say $IE_1 = 578$, $IE_2 = 1817$, $IE_3 = 2745$, $IE_4 = 11{,}577$ kJ/mol — the sharp jump between $IE_3$ and $IE_4$ signals that the element has exactly three valence electrons (consistent with aluminum, group 13). This reasoning lets chemists infer an element's group placement, and hence its likely bonding behavior and oxidation states, purely from a sequence of energy measurements — without needing to know its identity in advance.

## Periodic Table Groups

**Definition.** The periodic table arranges the 118 known elements into rows (periods) and columns (groups, or families). Elements in the same group share the same number of valence electrons — the electrons in the outermost occupied shell — which is why they display similar chemical behavior. For example, Group 1 (the alkali metals: Li, Na, K, ...) each have one valence electron and react vigorously with water; Group 17 (the halogens: F, Cl, Br, ...) each have seven valence electrons and readily gain one more to complete a stable octet. Group 18 (the noble gases) have a full valence shell and are chemically inert under most conditions. This organization is not arbitrary bookkeeping — it reflects the quantum-mechanical structure of electron shells, so knowing an element's group tells you a great deal about its reactivity, bonding tendencies, and physical properties without memorizing each element individually.

**Worked example.** Suppose you're asked to predict the formula of the compound formed between magnesium (Mg, Group 2) and chlorine (Cl, Group 17). Mg has 2 valence electrons and tends to lose both to reach a stable configuration, forming Mg$^{2+}$. Cl has 7 valence electrons and tends to gain 1 to form Cl$^-$. To balance charge, you need two Cl$^-$ ions for every Mg$^{2+}$ ion, giving the formula MgCl$_2$. This is exactly the reasoning chemists use before ever running an experiment — group position alone predicts the ionic charge and, from there, the compound's stoichiometry.

**Problem-solving application.** Group position is a diagnostic tool. Given an unfamiliar element, you can locate its group to predict: (1) its likely ionic charge (Group 1 → +1, Group 2 → +2, Group 16 → −2, Group 17 → −1), (2) whether it will form compounds with a given partner and in what ratio, and (3) trends like reactivity (increasing down Group 1, decreasing down Group 17) or atomic size (increasing down any group). For instance, to predict the formula for the compound between aluminum (Group 13, forms Al$^{3+}$) and oxygen (Group 16, forms O$^{2-}$), find the least common multiple of the charges (6), requiring 2 Al and 3 O: Al$_2$O$_3$. Practicing this charge-balancing method across many group pairs builds the same predictive fluency a chemist uses when encountering a new reaction.

## Metallic Character

Metallic character describes how readily an element's atoms lose electrons to form positive ions, along with the physical and chemical behaviors that follow: shiny luster, malleability, electrical conductivity, and a tendency to form basic oxides and ionic compounds with nonmetals. Across the periodic table, metallic character increases going down a group and decreases going left to right across a period. Both trends trace back to the same underlying cause — how tightly the nucleus holds its outermost electrons, which is governed by atomic radius and effective nuclear charge. Moving down a group, atomic radius increases because electrons occupy higher energy levels farther from the nucleus, and inner-shell electrons shield the outer electrons from the nucleus's pull. The outermost electrons are therefore easier to remove, so metallic character rises. Moving across a period, atomic radius shrinks and effective nuclear charge grows, so outer electrons are held more tightly, making the element less willing to lose electrons — metallic character falls, and nonmetallic character rises.

**Worked example.** Rank the following by increasing metallic character: chlorine (Cl), sodium (Na), aluminum (Al), potassium (K). Cl, Na, and Al are in Period 3; K is in Period 4, Group 1. Within Period 3, metallic character decreases left to right, so Na > Al > Cl. K sits below Na in Group 1, and metallic character increases down a group, so K > Na. Combining these: Cl < Al < Na < K.

**Problem-solving application.** Metallic character predicts real chemical behavior, not just table position. Consider two questions a chemist might ask: (1) Which oxide is more basic, MgO or SO$_3$? Since Mg is more metallic than S, MgO is basic (reacts with acids), while SO$_3$ is acidic (reacts with bases) — metal oxides trend basic, nonmetal oxides trend acidic. (2) Which reacts more vigorously with water, Li or Cs? Cs, being far down Group 1, has greater metallic character than Li and loses its valence electron more easily, producing a much more violent reaction. This reasoning lets you predict reactivity, oxide behavior, and bonding type (ionic vs. covalent) for unfamiliar elements just from their position on the periodic table, without needing to memorize each element's individual properties.

## Representative Elements

A representative element is a single data point, sample, or case chosen from a larger group so that studying it tells you something reliable about the group as a whole. The idea shows up everywhere: a doctor draws one vial of blood to infer facts about your entire circulatory system; a pollster surveys 1,000 voters to estimate the preferences of 150 million; a quality-control engineer inspects 20 bolts from a batch of 50,000. The core assumption is that the chosen element shares the relevant properties of the population it stands in for — it is not an outlier, and it was not selected in a way that systematically favors one outcome.

**Worked example.** Suppose a factory produces 10,000 light bulbs per day, and you want to know the average bulb lifetime. Testing every bulb would destroy the entire batch, so you instead pull 50 bulbs at random and test those. If the 50 bulbs are chosen without bias — say, using a random number generator to pick production slots rather than grabbing the first 50 off the line — their average lifetime is a representative estimate of the whole batch's average lifetime. Note the two things that can break representativeness: (1) a bad sampling method (grabbing only the first 50 bulbs might miss defects that appear later in a shift), and (2) too small a sample (5 bulbs is more likely to be skewed by one unusually short-lived unit than 50 bulbs).

**Problem-solving application.** When you encounter a claim built on limited evidence, ask two diagnostic questions: How was the representative element selected, and is the group it's drawn from actually comparable to the group the conclusion is applied to? For instance, if a nutrition study tests a supplement on 30 male athletes and then claims the results apply to all adults, the sample fails on the second question — athletes are not representative of the general population's metabolism or activity level. In practice, this reasoning generalizes beyond statistics: choosing one function to test a piece of code, one paragraph to proofread for a whole document's style, or one city to pilot a policy before a national rollout are all applications of the same principle — pick an element deliberately, verify it isn't an edge case, and only then trust it to speak for the whole.

## Alkali Metals

The alkali metals — lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and francium (Fr) — occupy Group 1 of the periodic table. Each has a single valence electron in an $ns^1$ configuration, sitting alone outside a stable noble-gas core. That lone electron is loosely held and easily removed, which explains why alkali metals share a strikingly consistent chemical personality: they are soft, low-density, low-melting solids that react vigorously with water, halogens, and oxygen, almost always forming +1 cations. Reactivity increases down the group (Li is the mildest, Cs is explosively reactive) because the valence electron sits farther from the nucleus and is shielded by more inner-shell electrons, so it takes less energy to remove.

**Worked example.** Consider the reaction of sodium with water:
$$2\text{Na}(s) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow 2\text{NaOH}(aq) + \text{H}_2(g)$$
Sodium loses its single valence electron to water, forming Na⁺ and hydroxide ions while hydrogen gas is released — often with enough heat to ignite the gas. If you compare this to potassium in the same reaction, the process is identical in mechanism but proceeds faster and more violently, because potassium's valence electron is even easier to strip away. This trend lets you predict relative reactivity without memorizing separate facts for each element: locate the element in Group 1, note its row, and rank reactivity by distance from the nucleus.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're asked to predict which alkali metal would react most vigorously with chlorine gas to form a salt, given a table of first ionization energies: Li (520 kJ/mol), Na (496), K (419), Rb (403), Cs (376). Since forming an ionic bond with chlorine requires losing the valence electron, the metal with the *lowest* ionization energy will react fastest — here, cesium. This same reasoning generalizes to industrial and safety contexts: alkali metals are stored under mineral oil or inert gas precisely because their reactivity with atmospheric moisture scales with position in the group, and engineers handling cesium must take far more stringent precautions than those handling lithium. Recognizing periodic trends as predictive tools, rather than as isolated facts to memorize, is the core problem-solving skill this concept develops.

## Electrolysis

Electrolysis is the process of using electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction — typically decomposing a compound into its elements or simpler substances. A direct current source is connected to two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) immersed in a molten or dissolved electrolyte. At the cathode, reduction occurs as electrons are supplied to positive ions (cations); at the anode, oxidation occurs as electrons are pulled away from negative ions (anions) or from the electrode material itself. Unlike a galvanic cell, which generates electricity spontaneously from a favorable reaction, electrolysis forces an unfavorable reaction to proceed by supplying external energy.

**Worked example.** Consider the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride (NaCl), a classic industrial process for producing sodium metal and chlorine gas. At the cathode, sodium ions gain electrons: $\text{Na}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \text{Na}(l)$. At the anode, chloride ions lose electrons: $2\text{Cl}^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2(g) + 2e^-$. Combining these half-reactions (balancing electrons) gives the overall reaction: $2\text{NaCl}(l) \rightarrow 2\text{Na}(l) + \text{Cl}_2(g)$.

The one new tool we need to quantify electrolysis is **Faraday's law**: the amount of product formed is proportional to the total electric charge passed through the cell. Charge is current multiplied by time ($Q = It$, in coulombs), and every 96,485 coulombs of charge corresponds to one mole of electrons — a quantity called Faraday's constant, $F$. So moles of electrons $= Q/F$.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a current of 5.0 A is passed through molten NaCl for 2 hours. Charge passed: $Q = It = (5.0\ \text{A})(7200\ \text{s}) = 36{,}000\ \text{C}$. Moles of electrons: $36{,}000 / 96{,}485 \approx 0.373\ \text{mol } e^-$.

Now apply the stoichiometry from the half-reactions above. One electron produces one atom of Na, so we get about 0.373 mol Na — roughly 8.6 g. Two electrons are needed per molecule of $\text{Cl}_2$, so we get half as many moles of gas: about 0.187 mol, or roughly 4.18 L at standard conditions.

This pattern — current and time give charge, charge and Faraday's constant give moles of electrons, and the balanced half-reactions convert that into moles of product — is the essential skill for solving any electrolysis problem, whether refining aluminum, electroplating metal, or producing hydrogen fuel by splitting water.

## Downs Cell

The Downs cell is the electrochemical device used to produce metallic sodium industrially through the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. Because sodium is more reactive than hydrogen, it cannot be isolated from an aqueous solution of NaCl — water would simply be reduced at the cathode instead. The Downs cell solves this by electrolyzing molten NaCl (melting point 801°C, typically lowered to around 600°C by mixing in calcium chloride), where the only available species to reduce and oxidize are Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions themselves.

Inside the cell, a cylindrical carbon anode is surrounded by a ring-shaped steel cathode, separated by an iron mesh diaphragm that keeps the products apart. At the cathode, sodium ions are reduced: $\text{Na}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \text{Na}(l)$. At the anode, chloride ions are oxidized: $2\text{Cl}^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2(g) + 2e^-$. The overall reaction is $2\text{NaCl}(l) \rightarrow 2\text{Na}(l) + \text{Cl}_2(g)$. Liquid sodium, being less dense than the molten salt, rises and is collected under an inert atmosphere (to prevent it reacting with air), while chlorine gas is captured separately as a valuable byproduct used in PVC and disinfectant production.

**Worked example**: Suppose a Downs cell operates at a current of 50,000 A for one hour. How much sodium metal is produced? Using Faraday's law, the charge passed is $Q = It = 50{,}000 \times 3600 = 1.8 \times 10^8\ \text{C}$. Since one mole of electrons carries $F = 96{,}485\ \text{C}$, the moles of electrons are $1.8\times10^8 / 96{,}485 \approx 1866\ \text{mol}$. Each Na⁺ requires exactly one electron, so moles of Na produced $\approx 1866\ \text{mol}$, giving a mass of $1866 \times 23.0\ \text{g/mol} \approx 42{,}900\ \text{g}$, or about 42.9 kg.

**Problem-solving application**: This kind of calculation is essential for process engineers scaling electrolysis operations — given a target production rate (say, tons of sodium per day), you can work backward using Faraday's law to determine the required current, cell size, and number of parallel cells needed, which directly informs plant design and energy cost estimates.

## Payoff

The Downs cell is the point where every idea in this book — ionic bonding, molten-salt conductivity, oxidation and reduction, Faraday's laws of electrolysis — converges into a single working machine. It is not just an illustration of electrolysis; it is the industrial solution to a problem that stumped chemists for a century: how do you extract a metal, sodium, that is more reactive than the water and air around it, without the metal instantly recombining with its surroundings? By melting sodium chloride at roughly $800\,^{\circ}\text{C}$ and passing direct current through it, the cell forces $\text{Na}^+$ ions to the cathode, where they gain an electron and become liquid sodium, while $\text{Cl}^-$ ions migrate to the anode and are oxidized to chlorine gas. A cylindrical steel screen keeps the two products physically separated, because sodium metal reacts violently with chlorine the instant they touch. Everything else in the concept-book — Arrhenius's dissociation of salts, Faraday's charge-to-mass relationship $m = \dfrac{Q \cdot M}{n F}$, and the thermodynamics of why molten salt conducts while solid salt does not — exists to explain why this specific arrangement of electrodes, temperature, and geometry works.

This is why the Downs cell is the natural endpoint: it is the concept where chemistry stops being descriptive and becomes engineering. The same electrolytic logic scales directly into the applications that depend on it. It supplies the metallic sodium used in the Kroll and related processes that refine titanium and other reactive metals, since sodium's strong reducing power lets it strip oxygen and chlorine from ores that cannot be refined by ordinary carbon reduction. It underlies the chlor-alkali branch of industrial chemistry, where the same anode reaction produces the chlorine feedstock for PVC, water treatment, and pharmaceuticals. It connects to battery and energy-storage research, where sodium-based systems are being explored as lower-cost alternatives to lithium. And it grounds the broader engineering discipline of process safety, since containing a cell that produces a violently reactive metal and a toxic gas simultaneously is itself a design problem worth studying.

From here, the most rewarding path is to follow sodium out of the cell and into the Kroll process, tracing exactly how the metal you now know how to produce becomes the reducing agent that makes modern titanium possible.

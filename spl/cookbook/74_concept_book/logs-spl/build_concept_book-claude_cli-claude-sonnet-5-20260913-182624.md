## Matter

**Definition.** In classical physics, *matter* is any substance that possesses mass and occupies volume, thereby exhibiting inertia and interacting through gravitational and electromagnetic forces. Formally, a body of matter is characterized by a mass density function $\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$, defined so that the total mass in a region $V$ is

$$
m = \int_V \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)\, dV.
$$

Matter is distinguished from massless fields (such as electromagnetic radiation in vacuum) by satisfying $\rho > 0$ almost everywhere in its occupied domain, and by obeying conservation of mass, expressed locally via the continuity equation.

**Worked example.** Consider a thin rod of length $L$ with linear mass density $\lambda(x) = \lambda_0\left(1 + \dfrac{x}{L}\right)$ for $x \in [0, L]$. The total mass is

$$
m = \int_0^L \lambda_0\left(1 + \frac{x}{L}\right) dx = \lambda_0\left[x + \frac{x^2}{2L}\right]_0^L = \frac{3}{2}\lambda_0 L.
$$

This illustrates how the abstract definition of matter as mass-bearing substance reduces to an integral computation once a density function is specified.

**Key theorem (Conservation of Mass).** For a closed system with no mass flux across its boundary $\partial V$, the total mass is conserved:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\int_V \rho\, dV = -\oint_{\partial V} \rho\, \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{n}\, dA = 0,
$$

which follows from the divergence theorem applied to the continuity equation $\partial_t \rho + \nabla\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v}) = 0$.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

x, L, lam0 = sp.symbols('x L lambda_0', positive=True)
lam = lam0 * (1 + x/L)
mass = sp.integrate(lam, (x, 0, L))
print(sp.simplify(mass))  # 3*L*lambda_0/2
```
```

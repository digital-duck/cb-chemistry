## Intermolecular Forces

**Definition.** Intermolecular forces are the attractions that act *between* molecules, distinct from the covalent or ionic bonds that hold atoms together *within* a molecule. Three main types matter for most chemistry problems. London dispersion forces arise in all molecules from momentary, shifting imbalances in electron distribution, and grow stronger with more electrons and larger, more polarizable surface area. Dipole-dipole forces occur between molecules with a permanent unequal sharing of electrons (a dipole), where the partially positive end of one molecule attracts the partially negative end of another. Hydrogen bonding, the strongest of the three, occurs when a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (N, O, or F) is attracted to a lone pair on a nearby electronegative atom. The strength ordering is generally hydrogen bonding > dipole-dipole > dispersion, though large enough molecules can have dispersion forces that outweigh dipole-dipole forces in smaller ones.

**Worked example.** Compare the boiling points of butane ($\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}$, bp $-1\,^\circ\text{C}$) and diethyl ether ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OC}_2\text{H}_5$, bp $35\,^\circ\text{C}$), two molecules of similar molar mass. Butane is nonpolar, so its molecules interact only through dispersion forces. Diethyl ether has a bent C–O–C arrangement with an oxygen atom that gives it a net dipole, adding dipole-dipole attraction on top of dispersion forces. Because boiling requires overcoming intermolecular attractions, the ether's additional dipole-dipole interaction demands more thermal energy, explaining its higher boiling point despite comparable size.

**Problem-solving application.** When ranking boiling or melting points, work through molecules in this order: first check for O–H or N–H bonds (hydrogen bonding present); if absent, check for a permanent dipole from unequal electronegativity and asymmetric shape (dipole-dipole present); if the molecule is symmetric and nonpolar, only dispersion forces apply, and size/surface area become the deciding factor. For example, predict which boils higher: methanol ($\text{CH}_3\text{OH}$) or ethane ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_6$), both with similar molar mass. Methanol has an O–H bond capable of hydrogen bonding; ethane has only dispersion forces. Methanol's boiling point ($65\,^\circ\text{C}$) is far higher than ethane's ($-89\,^\circ\text{C}$), confirming the rule. This stepwise check — hydrogen bonding, then dipole, then dispersion — is the reliable strategy for predicting relative physical properties from molecular structure alone.

## Solution

A **solution** is any value, or set of values, that makes an equation, inequality, or system of equations true when substituted for the unknown(s). Solving is the process of finding that value systematically, rather than guessing. Every solution must be verifiable: substituting it back into the original problem should produce a true statement. This verification step is what separates a rigorous solution from a lucky guess.

**Worked example.** Consider the linear equation $3x - 7 = 2x + 5$. To solve, isolate $x$ by performing the same operation on both sides. Subtract $2x$ from both sides: $x - 7 = 5$. Add 7 to both sides: $x = 12$. Check: $3(12) - 7 = 29$ and $2(12) + 5 = 29$. Both sides match, so $x = 12$ is confirmed as the solution.

Now consider a slightly harder case: the quadratic $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$. Factoring gives $(x-2)(x-3) = 0$, so $x = 2$ and $x = 3$ are both solutions — a reminder that a "solution" need not be unique. Substituting each value back confirms both satisfy the original equation.

**Problem-solving application.** In practice, most real problems don't arrive as a clean equation — they arrive as a scenario, and translating the scenario into an equation is the actual skill being tested. Suppose a rectangular garden's length is 3 meters more than its width, and its area is 40 square meters. Let $w$ represent the width; then the length is $w + 3$, and the area equation is $w(w+3) = 40$, or $w^2 + 3w - 40 = 0$. Factoring gives $(w+8)(w-5) = 0$, yielding $w = -8$ or $w = 5$. Here the algebra produces two mathematically valid roots, but only one is a valid *solution to the problem*: width cannot be negative, so $w = -8$ is rejected on physical grounds, leaving $w = 5$ meters (and length 8 meters) as the answer.

This distinction — between an equation's roots and a problem's admissible solutions — is central to applied problem-solving. Always check candidate solutions against both the original equation and the real-world constraints (domain restrictions, sign conventions, units) that the equation was built to represent.

## Molality

Molality ($m$) measures the concentration of a solution as moles of solute per kilogram of solvent:

$$m = \frac{n_{\text{solute}}}{m_{\text{solvent}} \, (\text{kg})}$$

Molality differs from molarity in a way that matters for real applications: molarity depends on the total volume of solution, which changes with temperature as liquids expand or contract. Molality depends only on mass, which is temperature-independent. This makes molality the preferred unit whenever a calculation must hold across a range of temperatures — most importantly, in colligative property calculations like freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation.

**Worked example.** Suppose you dissolve 34.2 g of sucrose ($\text{C}_{12}\text{H}_{22}\text{O}_{11}$, molar mass 342.3 g/mol) in 500 g of water. First find moles of solute:

$$n = \frac{34.2\ \text{g}}{342.3\ \text{g/mol}} = 0.100\ \text{mol}$$

Convert solvent mass to kilograms: $500\ \text{g} = 0.500\ \text{kg}$. Then:

$$m = \frac{0.100\ \text{mol}}{0.500\ \text{kg}} = 0.200\ \text{mol/kg} = 0.200\ m$$

**Problem-solving application.** Molality's real payoff is in predicting how a solute shifts a solvent's phase-change temperature. The freezing-point depression law states:

$$\Delta T_f = i \, K_f \, m$$

where $K_f$ is the solvent's freezing-point depression constant (for water, $1.86\ °\text{C·kg/mol}$) and $i$ is the van't Hoff factor — the number of particles the solute dissociates into (1 for sucrose, 2 for NaCl, 3 for CaCl$_2$).

Suppose you want to prevent a car's coolant (water-based) from freezing above $-10.0\ °\text{C}$ using ethylene glycol (non-dissociating, $i = 1$). Solve for the required molality:

$$m = \frac{\Delta T_f}{K_f} = \frac{10.0\ °\text{C}}{1.86\ °\text{C·kg/mol}} = 5.38\ \text{mol/kg}$$

This tells an engineer exactly how many moles of glycol must be added per kilogram of water — independent of how the mixture's volume changes as it cools. This is precisely why antifreeze formulations, road de-icing salts, and cryopreservation protocols are all specified in molality rather than molarity: the calculation must remain valid as temperature — and therefore volume — changes.

## Solvent And Solute

A solution forms when one substance dissolves uniformly into another. The **solute** is the substance being dissolved and present in the smaller amount; the **solvent** is the substance doing the dissolving and present in the larger amount. When you stir sugar into water, sugar is the solute and water is the solvent. This distinction matters because the solvent's chemical properties — polarity, temperature, and molecular structure — largely determine how much solute can dissolve and how the mixture behaves.

Dissolving happens because solvent molecules surround and separate solute particles, overcoming the forces holding the solute together and replacing them with new solute–solvent interactions. Water, a polar molecule, dissolves other polar or ionic substances (like salt or sugar) but resists mixing with nonpolar substances (like oil). This "like dissolves like" principle explains why water and vegetable oil separate into layers instead of forming a solution: water molecules interact strongly with each other and with other polar molecules, but they cannot form comparable attractions with oil's nonpolar molecules.

**Worked example**: You dissolve 10 grams of salt into 200 grams of water. Which is the solute, and what is the solution's concentration by mass? Salt is the solute (smaller mass, being dissolved); water is the solvent. Total solution mass is $10 + 200 = 210$ g. Concentration by mass is:

$$
\text{mass percent} = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \times 100\% = \frac{10}{210} \times 100\% \approx 4.76\%
$$

**Problem-solving application**: Suppose you need to prepare 500 g of a 5% saline solution for a lab experiment. How much salt (solute) and how much water (solvent) do you need? Set up the mass-percent equation with the unknown solute mass $x$:

$$
0.05 = \frac{x}{500} \implies x = 25 \text{ g of salt}
$$

The remaining mass is solvent: $500 - 25 = 475$ g of water. This kind of calculation — rearranging the concentration formula to solve for an unknown component — is the core skill used throughout chemistry, from mixing lab reagents to formulating medications, where getting the solute-to-solvent ratio precisely right is essential for safety and effectiveness.

## Colligative Property

A colligative property is a physical property of a solution that depends on the *number* of dissolved solute particles relative to the amount of solvent, but not on the *identity* of those particles. Whether the solute is sugar, salt, or ethylene glycol, what matters is how many particles it contributes to the solution — not its chemical nature. The four classic colligative properties are vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure. Each arises because adding solute particles dilutes the solvent's presence at the surface or interferes with its ability to form an ordered solid phase, shifting the equilibrium conditions.

The freezing point depression is a useful entry point because it is easy to compute and directly applicable: $\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m$, where $m$ is the molality of the solution, $K_f$ is the solvent's freezing point depression constant, and $i$ is the van't Hoff factor — the number of particles each formula unit produces upon dissolving (for glucose, $i = 1$; for NaCl, $i \approx 2$, since it dissociates into Na⁺ and Cl⁻).

**Worked example.** Suppose you dissolve 58.5 g of NaCl (molar mass 58.5 g/mol, so 1 mol) in 1.0 kg of water. The molality is $m = 1.0\ \text{mol/kg}$. Water's $K_f = 1.86\ ^\circ\text{C·kg/mol}$. Since NaCl dissociates into two ions, $i = 2$. Then $\Delta T_f = 2 \times 1.86 \times 1.0 = 3.72\ ^\circ\text{C}$, so the solution freezes at $-3.72\ ^\circ\text{C}$ instead of $0\ ^\circ\text{C}$.

**Problem-solving application.** This is exactly why road crews spread salt on icy pavement: the dissolved ions lower the freezing point of the water film on the road, keeping it liquid at temperatures where pure water would freeze. Similarly, antifreeze (ethylene glycol) in a car radiator both raises the boiling point and lowers the freezing point of the coolant, since it doesn't dissociate ($i=1$) but still contributes particles. When solving colligative property problems, always identify $i$ correctly first — forgetting that ionic compounds dissociate is the most common source of error — then apply the appropriate formula for the property in question (freezing point, boiling point, or osmotic pressure) using consistent concentration units.

## Solvation

Solvation is the process by which solvent molecules surround and interact with the particles of a dissolved solute, stabilizing them in solution. When a solute — ionic, polar, or nonpolar — disperses into a solvent, it does not simply mix in passively; each solute particle becomes enveloped by a shell of solvent molecules oriented to maximize favorable electrostatic or intermolecular interactions. When the solvent is water, this specific case is called hydration. Solvation is the reason "like dissolves like": solvents dissolve solutes efficiently only when the intermolecular forces they can offer match the forces the solute needs replaced.

Consider table salt, NaCl, dissolving in water. Sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ions ($\text{Cl}^-$) are held together in the solid by strong ionic bonds. Water molecules, being polar, have a partial negative charge on oxygen and partial positive charges on the hydrogens. When NaCl is added to water, the oxygen ends of water molecules cluster around each $\text{Na}^+$ ion, while the hydrogen ends orient toward each $\text{Cl}^-$ ion. This shell of oriented water molecules stabilizes the separated ions well enough that the energy released compensates for breaking the ionic lattice, so the salt dissolves. The same principle explains why oil does not dissolve in water: water cannot form comparably favorable interactions with oil's nonpolar hydrocarbon chains, so the nonpolar molecules are excluded rather than solvated.

Solvation also governs practical problem-solving in chemistry, biology, and engineering. Suppose you need to select a solvent to extract a nonpolar organic compound from an aqueous mixture. Applying the solvation principle, you would choose a nonpolar solvent, such as hexane or dichloromethane, because it can solvate the nonpolar compound through dispersion forces, while the polar water phase cannot. This is the working basis of liquid-liquid extraction, a standard laboratory separation technique. Similarly, in biology, the solvation of ions and polar side chains by water drives protein folding: nonpolar amino acid residues avoid unfavorable interactions with water and cluster in the protein's interior, while polar and charged residues remain solvated at the surface. Understanding solvation therefore lets you predict solubility, design separations, and reason about molecular structure across chemistry, materials science, and the life sciences.

## Ideal Solution

An **ideal solution** is a hypothetical mixture in which the interactions between different molecules are essentially identical to the interactions between molecules of the same kind. If you mix substance A and substance B, an ideal solution requires that an A–B interaction feels, energetically, just like an A–A or B–B interaction. Because nothing is gained or lost energetically by mixing, the process involves no heat exchange ($\Delta H_{\text{mix}} = 0$) and no change in total volume ($\Delta V_{\text{mix}} = 0$) beyond simply adding the components together.

This behavior is captured quantitatively by **Raoult's Law**, which states that the partial vapor pressure of each component above the solution is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid:

$$P_A = X_A P_A^*$$

where $P_A^*$ is the vapor pressure of pure A and $X_A$ is its mole fraction in solution. This relationship is intrinsically mathematical — you cannot predict how a mixture's vapor pressure changes without it — so it earns its place as a working formula here, unlike purely procedural concepts.

**Worked example:** Suppose you mix benzene and toluene, a classic near-ideal pair, in a 1:1 mole ratio. At a given temperature, pure benzene has $P^*_{\text{benzene}} = 100$ torr and pure toluene has $P^*_{\text{toluene}} = 40$ torr. With $X_{\text{benzene}} = X_{\text{toluene}} = 0.5$:

$$P_{\text{benzene}} = 0.5 \times 100 = 50 \text{ torr}, \quad P_{\text{toluene}} = 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \text{ torr}$$

The total vapor pressure above the solution is $P_{\text{total}} = 70$ torr — a simple weighted average, exactly what ideality predicts.

**Problem-solving application:** The real payoff of this concept is diagnostic. If you measure a solution's actual vapor pressure and it's *higher* than Raoult's Law predicts, the components are interacting more weakly with each other than with themselves (positive deviation — think water and ethanol, where hydrogen bonding is disrupted). If it's *lower*, unusually strong A–B attractions are suppressing evaporation (negative deviation — acetone and chloroform, which form hydrogen bonds). Chemists use this gap between predicted and observed pressure to infer molecular-level interactions without ever directly "seeing" them — the ideal solution model serves as the baseline against which real chemical behavior is measured.

## Mole Fraction

Mole fraction is a way of expressing concentration that compares the number of moles of one component to the total number of moles in a mixture. For a component $i$ in a solution with $n$ total components, the mole fraction $x_i$ is defined as

$$
x_i = \frac{n_i}{n_{\text{total}}} = \frac{n_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} n_j}
$$

where $n_i$ is the number of moles of component $i$. Because every mole in the mixture is accounted for, the mole fractions of all components always sum to 1: $\sum_i x_i = 1$. Unlike molarity or molality, mole fraction has no units — it is a dimensionless ratio — which makes it especially useful in contexts like vapor pressure calculations (Raoult's Law) and gas mixtures, where the underlying physics depends on the relative number of particles rather than volume or mass.

**Worked example.** Suppose you dissolve 2.00 mol of ethanol ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}$) in 8.00 mol of water. The total moles in solution are $2.00 + 8.00 = 10.00$ mol. The mole fraction of ethanol is

$$
x_{\text{ethanol}} = \frac{2.00}{10.00} = 0.200
$$

and the mole fraction of water is $x_{\text{water}} = 8.00/10.00 = 0.800$. Notice that $0.200 + 0.800 = 1$, confirming the fractions are self-consistent.

**Problem-solving application.** Mole fraction problems often start from mass rather than moles, so the first step is usually a unit conversion using molar mass. Consider a solution made from 36.0 g of water ($M = 18.0$ g/mol) and 46.0 g of ethanol ($M = 46.0$ g/mol). Converting to moles: $n_{\text{water}} = 36.0/18.0 = 2.00$ mol, and $n_{\text{ethanol}} = 46.0/46.0 = 1.00$ mol. The total is 3.00 mol, giving $x_{\text{water}} = 2.00/3.00 = 0.667$ and $x_{\text{ethanol}} = 1.00/3.00 = 0.333$.

This same logic extends directly to gas mixtures: in a closed container, the mole fraction of a gas equals its partial pressure divided by the total pressure ($x_i = P_i/P_{\text{total}}$), because at fixed temperature and volume, moles and pressure are proportional. Recognizing this connection lets you solve gas-mixture problems — such as finding the partial pressure of oxygen in air — using the same mole-fraction framework, without needing separate formulas for gases versus liquids.

---

## Vapor Pressure

**Definition.** Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a substance's vapor when it is in dynamic equilibrium with its liquid (or solid) phase in a closed container. At any temperature, molecules at the liquid's surface with enough kinetic energy escape into the gas phase (evaporation), while gas molecules simultaneously strike the surface and rejoin the liquid (condensation). Equilibrium is reached when these two rates are equal — not when evaporation stops, but when it is exactly balanced by condensation. Because higher temperature gives more molecules enough energy to escape, vapor pressure rises steeply and nonlinearly with temperature; this relationship is captured by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation,
$$\ln\!\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = -\frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right),$$
which links vapor pressure at two temperatures to the enthalpy of vaporization $\Delta H_{vap}$. This equation is necessary here because vapor pressure vs. temperature is not linear, and predicting it at an untabulated temperature requires this exponential relationship.

**Worked example.** Water has a vapor pressure of 23.8 mmHg at 25°C and a $\Delta H_{vap}$ of 40.7 kJ/mol. What is its vapor pressure at 50°C? Using $R = 8.314$ J/(mol·K), $T_1 = 298$ K, $T_2 = 323$ K:
$$\ln\!\left(\frac{P_2}{23.8}\right) = -\frac{40700}{8.314}\left(\frac{1}{323} - \frac{1}{298}\right) \approx 1.28$$
Solving gives $P_2 \approx 23.8 \times e^{1.28} \approx 85$ mmHg — close to the experimental value of about 92 mmHg, with the discrepancy arising because $\Delta H_{vap}$ itself varies slightly with temperature.

**Problem-solving application.** Vapor pressure explains and predicts everyday phenomena: a liquid boils when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure, which is why water boils below 100°C at high altitude (lower atmospheric pressure) and why pressure cookers raise boiling point by increasing pressure. It also governs practical engineering decisions — selecting refrigerants (which need high vapor pressure at low temperature), designing sealed containers for volatile chemicals, and calculating evaporation rates in industrial drying processes. Given any two temperature–pressure data points and $\Delta H_{vap}$, you can solve for pressure at a new temperature or, conversely, solve for the boiling point at a given external pressure by setting $P_2$ equal to that pressure.

---

## Raoults Law

Raoult's Law describes how the vapor pressure of a solvent changes when a solute is dissolved in it. For an ideal solution, the partial vapor pressure of a component equals the vapor pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the liquid mixture:

$$P_{\text{solution}} = X_{\text{solvent}} \cdot P_{\text{solvent}}^{\circ}$$

Here $P_{\text{solvent}}^{\circ}$ is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent, and $X_{\text{solvent}}$ is its mole fraction (moles of solvent divided by total moles in solution). The law captures a simple physical idea: adding solute particles takes up space at the liquid surface, so fewer solvent molecules escape into the vapor phase per unit time, lowering the vapor pressure proportionally to how "diluted" the solvent has become.

**Worked example.** Suppose you dissolve 1.00 mole of glucose (a nonvolatile solute) in 9.00 moles of water at 25°C, where pure water has a vapor pressure of 23.8 mmHg. The mole fraction of water is $X_{\text{water}} = 9.00 / (9.00 + 1.00) = 0.900$. Applying Raoult's Law:

$$P_{\text{solution}} = 0.900 \times 23.8 \text{ mmHg} = 21.4 \text{ mmHg}$$

The vapor pressure has dropped by about 2.4 mmHg simply because one-tenth of the surface molecules are now glucose rather than water.

**Problem-solving application.** Raoult's Law becomes especially useful when you need to work backward — for example, determining an unknown molar mass. Suppose a chemist dissolves 5.00 g of an unknown nonvolatile solute in 100.0 g of water (5.55 mol) and measures the solution's vapor pressure as 23.5 mmHg at 25°C. Solving for $X_{\text{water}}$:

$$X_{\text{water}} = \frac{23.5}{23.8} = 0.9874$$

Since $X_{\text{water}} = n_{\text{water}} / (n_{\text{water}} + n_{\text{solute}})$, rearranging gives $n_{\text{solute}} = n_{\text{water}}(1/X_{\text{water}} - 1) \approx 0.0709$ mol. Dividing the mass by moles yields a molar mass of about 70.5 g/mol — turning a pressure measurement into structural information about an unknown compound. This same reasoning underlies colligative-property techniques used throughout analytical chemistry.

---

## Vapor Pressure Lowering

When a nonvolatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, the vapor pressure of the resulting solution is lower than that of the pure solvent at the same temperature. This is one of the four **colligative properties**, meaning the effect depends on the *number* of solute particles present, not on what those particles are. Solute molecules occupy positions at the liquid's surface, reducing the fraction of surface area available to solvent molecules and lowering the rate at which they escape into the vapor phase.

This relationship is captured quantitatively by **Raoult's Law**:

$$P_{solution} = X_{solvent} \cdot P^{\circ}_{solvent}$$

where $P_{solution}$ is the vapor pressure of the solution, $X_{solvent}$ is the mole fraction of solvent, and $P^{\circ}_{solvent}$ is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. The amount of lowering, $\Delta P$, follows directly:

$$\Delta P = P^{\circ}_{solvent} - P_{solution} = X_{solute} \cdot P^{\circ}_{solvent}$$

**Worked example.** Suppose you dissolve 1.00 mol of glucose (a nonvolatile, non-dissociating solute) in 9.00 mol of water at 25°C, where pure water's vapor pressure is 23.8 torr. The mole fraction of water is $X_{water} = 9.00/(9.00+1.00) = 0.900$. Raoult's Law gives $P_{solution} = 0.900 \times 23.8 = 21.4$ torr, so $\Delta P = 2.4$ torr.

**Problem-solving application.** The law requires care with solutes that dissociate. If instead you dissolve 1.00 mol of NaCl, it separates into 2.00 mol of ions (Na⁺ and Cl⁻), each contributing independently to lowering the vapor pressure. You must use the *van't Hoff factor*, $i$, to count particles correctly: $X_{solute}$ is calculated using $i \times n_{solute}$ rather than $n_{solute}$ alone. For NaCl, $i \approx 2$, so the effective mole fraction of solute doubles, roughly doubling $\Delta P$ compared to a nondissociating solute at the same molal concentration. This distinction — total particles, not total formula units — is the single most common source of error when applying colligative-property calculations, and it reappears identically when computing boiling-point elevation and freezing-point depression for ionic solutes.

---

## Molarity

Molarity is a way of expressing how concentrated a solution is — how much solute is dissolved in a given volume of solvent. Formally, molarity ($M$) is defined as the number of moles of solute divided by the volume of solution in liters:

$$M = \frac{n}{V}$$

where $n$ is the amount of solute in moles and $V$ is the total volume of solution in liters. The units of molarity are $\text{mol/L}$, often written simply as $M$ (for example, "a 2 M solution of NaCl" means 2 moles of NaCl per liter of solution). Because molarity relates an amount of substance (moles) to a measured volume, it requires this precise mathematical definition — there is no purely qualitative way to describe "how concentrated" a solution is that would let you calculate reaction quantities.

**Worked example.** Suppose you dissolve 58.5 g of table salt (NaCl, molar mass $58.5 \text{ g/mol}$) in enough water to make 2.0 L of solution. First, convert mass to moles:

$$n = \frac{58.5\text{ g}}{58.5\text{ g/mol}} = 1.0 \text{ mol}$$

Then apply the definition of molarity:

$$M = \frac{1.0 \text{ mol}}{2.0 \text{ L}} = 0.5 \text{ M}$$

So the solution has a concentration of 0.5 mol/L.

**Problem-solving application.** Molarity becomes especially useful when diluting a stock solution to a weaker one — a routine task in labs, from preparing buffers in biology to titrations in analytical chemistry. When you add water to a solution, the volume increases but the amount of solute (in moles) stays exactly the same. Since $n = MV$ from the definition above, this means the product $MV$ before dilution must equal the product $MV$ after dilution:

$$M_1 V_1 = M_2 V_2$$

For instance, if you have 100 mL of a 6 M stock solution of hydrochloric acid and need to prepare 500 mL of a diluted solution, you can solve for the required initial volume:

$$V_1 = \frac{M_2 V_2}{M_1} = \frac{(1\text{ M})(500\text{ mL})}{6\text{ M}} \approx 83.3 \text{ mL}$$

This means you would measure out about 83.3 mL of the 6 M stock and add water until the total volume reaches 500 mL. Mastering this calculation is essential for any quantitative lab work.

---

## Osmosis

Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane, from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration, until equilibrium is reached or a counteracting pressure stops the flow. A semipermeable membrane allows small molecules like water to pass freely but blocks larger solutes such as sugars, salts, or proteins. Because the solute cannot cross, water moves instead, diluting the more concentrated side. This process requires no metabolic energy — it is driven entirely by the random thermal motion of water molecules and the resulting difference in water concentration between the two sides.

**Worked example.** Picture a U-shaped tube divided by a semipermeable membrane. One side holds pure water; the other holds water with dissolved salt. Salt ions cannot cross the membrane, but water molecules can. On the salty side, solute particles occupy space and effectively lower the concentration of free water molecules compared to the pure-water side. Water therefore diffuses from the pure-water side into the salty side, raising the fluid level there. This continues until the hydrostatic pressure created by the rising column — called osmotic pressure — pushes water back at the same rate it enters, producing a stable equilibrium.

**Problem-solving application.** Osmosis explains familiar biological and everyday phenomena, and reasoning through it is mostly about tracking which side has more free water. Consider a red blood cell placed in three different fluids: pure water (hypotonic), a solution matching the cell's internal salt concentration (isotonic), and concentrated saltwater (hypertonic). In the hypotonic solution, water flows into the cell, which can swell and burst. In the isotonic solution, water moves equally in both directions, so the cell's volume stays stable — this is why intravenous saline solutions are carefully matched to blood's solute concentration. In the hypertonic solution, water flows out, causing the cell to shrink. The same logic applies to preserving food with salt or sugar: the high external solute concentration draws water out of bacterial and fungal cells, dehydrating and killing them. Whenever you see a concentration gradient across a membrane permeable only to water, predicting the direction of osmosis is simply a matter of identifying which side is more dilute — water always moves toward the more concentrated solution.

## Boiling Point Elevation

When you dissolve a nonvolatile solute — one that doesn't itself evaporate — into a liquid solvent, the resulting solution boils at a higher temperature than the pure solvent does. This is boiling point elevation, and it belongs to a family of behaviors called colligative properties: effects that depend on how many solute particles are dissolved, not on what those particles chemically are. Adding salt, sugar, or any other nonvolatile solute to water raises its boiling point, and the size of the effect scales with particle concentration.

The reason is rooted in vapor pressure. A liquid boils when its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure. Solute particles occupy space at the liquid's surface and disrupt the solvent's ability to escape into vapor, lowering the vapor pressure at any given temperature. To restore boiling, you must heat the solution further. This relationship is captured by the equation:

$$\Delta T_b = i \cdot K_b \cdot m$$

Here, $\Delta T_b$ is the boiling point elevation, $K_b$ is the ebullioscopic constant (a property specific to the solvent, e.g., $0.512\ ^\circ\text{C·kg/mol}$ for water), $m$ is the molality of the solution (moles of solute per kilogram of solvent), and $i$ is the van't Hoff factor — the number of particles each solute unit produces in solution.

**Worked example**: Suppose you dissolve 1.0 mole of table salt (NaCl) in 1.0 kg of water. NaCl dissociates into two ions, Na⁺ and Cl⁻, so $i = 2$. Using water's $K_b = 0.512\ ^\circ\text{C·kg/mol}$:

$$\Delta T_b = 2 \times 0.512 \times 1.0 = 1.024\ ^\circ\text{C}$$

Water normally boils at $100\ ^\circ\text{C}$, so this solution boils at approximately $101.02\ ^\circ\text{C}$. Compare this to dissolving 1.0 mole of glucose (a molecular, non-dissociating solute) in the same amount of water: since $i = 1$, $\Delta T_b = 0.512\ ^\circ\text{C}$, only half as much elevation, despite using the same number of moles of solute.

**Problem-solving application**: This distinction — that ionic compounds elevate boiling point more than molecular ones at equal molality — is exactly why road crews use salt rather than sugar to melt ice (via the related freezing point depression), and why food scientists must account for salt content when calibrating candy-making thermometers. To solve real problems, always identify $i$ correctly first: check whether the solute dissociates, and into how many ions, before applying the formula.

## Freezing Point Depression

When a solute dissolves in a solvent, the resulting solution freezes at a lower temperature than the pure solvent. This phenomenon, called freezing point depression, occurs because dissolved particles disrupt the solvent's ability to organize into a solid lattice. For a liquid to freeze, its molecules must arrange into an ordered crystal structure; solute particles get in the way, interfering with this packing and lowering the equilibrium freezing point. Freezing point depression is a colligative property, meaning it depends on the *number* of dissolved particles, not their chemical identity.

The relationship is quantified as:

$$\Delta T_f = i K_f m$$

where $\Delta T_f$ is the freezing point depression (°C), $K_f$ is the solvent's freezing point depression constant (°C·kg/mol), $m$ is the molality of the solution (mol solute/kg solvent), and $i$ is the van't Hoff factor — the number of particles each solute unit produces in solution (1 for nonelectrolytes like sugar, 2 for NaCl, 3 for CaCl$_2$, and so on, assuming complete dissociation).

**Worked example:** Suppose you dissolve 58.5 g of NaCl (molar mass 58.5 g/mol, so 1.00 mol) in 1.00 kg of water. Water's $K_f = 1.86$ °C·kg/mol. Since NaCl dissociates into Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$, $i = 2$. The molality is $m = 1.00$ mol/kg. Then:

$$\Delta T_f = (2)(1.86)(1.00) = 3.72\ ^\circ\text{C}$$

Pure water freezes at 0°C, so this solution freezes at $-3.72$°C.

**Problem-solving application:** This principle explains why road crews spread salt on icy roads — salt dissolves into the thin water layer on ice, lowering its freezing point so ice melts even below 0°C. It also explains why antifreeze (ethylene glycol) is added to car radiators to prevent freezing in winter. A practical problem: if you want a coolant mixture to remain liquid down to $-10$°C, you can rearrange the formula to solve for the required molality, $m = \Delta T_f / (iK_f)$, then convert to a mass of solute per kilogram of solvent. This makes freezing point depression a genuinely useful design tool, not just a textbook curiosity — engineers use it to formulate de-icers, coolants, and even to determine unknown molar masses experimentally by measuring $\Delta T_f$ for a solution of known mass and back-solving for moles of solute.

## Osmotic Pressure

Osmotic pressure is the pressure that must be applied to a solution to stop the net inward flow of solvent across a semipermeable membrane separating it from pure solvent (or a more dilute solution). A semipermeable membrane allows small solvent molecules, usually water, to pass through while blocking larger solute particles. Because the solute cannot cross, water tends to move from the side with lower solute concentration to the side with higher solute concentration, diluting the more concentrated solution. This movement, called osmosis, continues until the pressure difference across the membrane balances the concentration difference driving the flow.

The relationship is captured by the van't Hoff equation, which treats a dilute solution's osmotic behavior as analogous to an ideal gas:
$$\Pi = i M R T$$
where $\Pi$ is osmotic pressure, $i$ is the van't Hoff factor (number of particles the solute dissociates into), $M$ is molarity, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is absolute temperature. This formalism is justified because osmotic pressure is fundamentally a statistical/thermodynamic quantity tied to particle concentration, not a mechanical or procedural concept.

**Worked example.** Suppose a 0.150 M solution of glucose (a nonelectrolyte, so $i = 1$) is separated from pure water by a semipermeable membrane at $37°C$ (310 K), body temperature. Using $R = 0.0821 \text{ L·atm/(mol·K)}$:
$$\Pi = (1)(0.150\text{ mol/L})(0.0821\text{ L·atm/mol·K})(310\text{ K}) \approx 3.82\text{ atm}$$
This is a substantial pressure — roughly 3.8 times atmospheric pressure — explaining why cells must tightly regulate internal solute concentrations to avoid swelling or shrinking.

**Problem-solving application.** Osmotic pressure calculations are essential in biology and medicine, particularly for determining whether an IV solution is isotonic (safe), hypotonic (causes cell swelling/lysis), or hypertonic (causes cell shrinkage). For example, if a saline solution has a lower osmotic pressure than blood plasma (roughly 7.7 atm), infusing it intravenously would cause red blood cells to absorb water and potentially rupture. Pharmaceutical scientists use the van't Hoff equation to formulate IV fluids and eye drops that match the body's osmotic pressure, and food scientists use osmosis principles to design preservation methods, since high solute concentrations (as in salting or sugaring) draw water out of microbial cells, inhibiting spoilage.

## Molar Mass Determination

Molar mass is the mass of one mole ($6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles) of a substance, expressed in grams per mole (g/mol). It provides the conversion bridge between the macroscopic quantity you can measure on a balance and the microscopic quantity of particles that actually react. For a compound, the molar mass is calculated by summing the atomic masses (from the periodic table) of every atom in its formula, each multiplied by how many times that atom appears.

**Worked example.** Consider glucose, $\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6$. Using atomic masses carbon = 12.01 g/mol, hydrogen = 1.008 g/mol, and oxygen = 16.00 g/mol:

$$
M = 6(12.01) + 12(1.008) + 6(16.00) = 72.06 + 12.10 + 96.00 = 180.16 \text{ g/mol}
$$

So one mole of glucose — 180.16 grams — contains $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ glucose molecules. This single number lets you move freely between mass and mole count using $n = m/M$, where $n$ is moles, $m$ is mass in grams, and $M$ is molar mass.

**Problem-solving application.** Molar mass determination is most useful when you don't already know the formula and must find it experimentally. Suppose a chemist isolates 2.50 g of an unknown gas and finds it occupies 1.37 L at standard temperature and pressure (0°C, 1 atm), where 1 mole of ideal gas occupies 22.4 L. First find moles:

$$
n = \frac{1.37 \text{ L}}{22.4 \text{ L/mol}} = 0.0612 \text{ mol}
$$

Then the molar mass is mass divided by moles:

$$
M = \frac{2.50 \text{ g}}{0.0612 \text{ mol}} \approx 40.8 \text{ g/mol}
$$

Comparing this to candidate formulas, 40.8 g/mol is close to argon (39.95 g/mol) or possibly $\text{CO}_2$ (44.01 g/mol) — experimental error and rounding often require you to weigh the closest match rather than expect an exact hit. This same logic underlies real techniques like mass spectrometry and freezing-point depression, where a measured physical property (mass, gas volume, or a colligative property) is used to back-calculate an unknown compound's identity, making molar mass determination a practical diagnostic tool rather than just a bookkeeping step in stoichiometry.

## Payoff

Every concept in this book has been building toward a single question: given a substance, how much does one mole of it weigh, and how does knowing that number let us cross between the world we can measure — grams on a scale — and the world we cannot see — atoms and molecules being counted and combined? Molar mass determination is the answer. It is the conversion factor that makes stoichiometry usable rather than theoretical: without it, a balanced equation tells you a ratio of particles, but not a single fact you could act on in a lab, a factory, or a body. With it, that same equation tells you exactly how many grams to weigh out, how much product to expect, and how much material is being wasted or produced. This is why molar mass determination is the natural endpoint of the book — it is the concept where symbolic knowledge (formulas, equations, periodic table entries) finally becomes operational knowledge (quantities you can pour, measure, and check).

The applications that follow are not separate topics — they are molar mass determination performing its function in different settings. In stoichiometric yield calculations, it converts a target quantity of product into the mass of reactants a chemist must weigh out, and converts theoretical yield into a number that can be compared against an experimental result. In pharmaceutical dosing, it converts a required number of drug molecules per kilogram of body weight into a prescribable mass, the step between a molecular target and a pill. In environmental and industrial mass-balance problems — tracking a pollutant through a reaction, or a nutrient through an ecosystem — it is what allows mass entering a system to be reconciled with mass leaving it, because mass balances are ultimately particle balances scaled by molar mass. In each domain, the concept is doing the same job: translating a count of particles into a mass a person can act on, and back again.

From here, the most productive next step is to choose one of these applications and work through it end to end — set up the balanced equation, identify the limiting reactant, and use molar mass to carry the calculation from grams in to grams out. Stoichiometric yield calculation is the most natural place to start, since it is the application in which every other concept in this book converges.

## Element

An **element** is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by ordinary chemical means. Each element is defined by its **atomic number**, $Z$, the number of protons in the nucleus of its atoms — change the number of protons and you have a different element entirely. As of the current periodic table, 118 elements are known, arranged by increasing atomic number and organized so that elements with similar chemical behavior fall into the same vertical column, or group.

**Worked example.** Consider carbon ($Z=6$) versus nitrogen ($Z=7$). Both are common in biological molecules, but a carbon atom has 6 protons while a nitrogen atom has 7. Because the number of protons differs, no chemical reaction can convert carbon into nitrogen — that transformation requires nuclear physics (fusion, fission, or radioactive decay), not chemistry. This is the practical test for "elementhood": if a process only rearranges electrons and bonds, the elements present before and after are identical.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you are given an unknown pure substance and told it decomposes under heat into two separate gases with different densities. Is it an element? No — by definition, an element cannot decompose into anything simpler. The observation that it split into two distinct substances tells you it was a compound, and the two gases produced are candidates for being elements (or could themselves be further decomposable compounds, which you would test the same way). This decomposition test is exactly how many elements, such as hydrogen and oxygen from water, were historically identified.

A related problem-solving skill is reading atomic number from context: given that a particle has 11 protons, you can identify it as sodium no matter what else is true about it — whether it has gained or lost electrons, or how many protons pair with it in the nucleus — because protons, and protons alone, define elemental identity. This is why sodium always sits in the same position on the periodic table: its identity as an element is fixed by $Z$, even when its charge or exact mass varies from one sample to another.

## Matter

Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. This definition is deliberately broad: it covers the desk you're sitting at, the air you're breathing, and the water in your glass, but it excludes things like light, heat, and sound, which carry energy but not mass. Matter exists in distinct physical forms called states — most commonly solid, liquid, and gas — distinguished by how tightly and how freely their particles (atoms or molecules) are arranged and able to move.

In a solid, particles are packed closely in a fixed arrangement, vibrating in place but not moving past one another; this gives solids a definite shape and volume. In a liquid, particles remain close together but can slide past each other, so a liquid has a definite volume but takes the shape of its container. In a gas, particles are far apart and move independently at high speed, so a gas has neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume — it expands to fill whatever container it's in.

Consider a worked example: 18 grams of water (about one tablespoon) is placed in a sealed, rigid 2-liter container and heated from 20°C to 150°C at sea-level atmospheric pressure. At 20°C, the water is liquid, sitting at the bottom of the container. As it's heated past 100°C, it boils and becomes water vapor — a gas. The mass stays exactly 18 grams throughout, since no matter enters or leaves the sealed container, but the volume occupied changes dramatically: the liquid occupied about 18 mL, while the vapor expands to fill the entire 2-liter container. This illustrates a key point: a change of state changes how matter is arranged and how much space it occupies, but not how much matter there is.

This distinction matters for problem-solving. If you're asked to track a substance through heating, cooling, or phase changes, mass is your conserved quantity — use it to set up conservation equations — while volume and shape are the variables that respond to the state the matter is in. When analyzing an experiment or an engineering system (a steam engine, a refrigerator, a sealed reaction vessel), always ask first: what state is this matter in, and is mass conserved across the process? Those two questions frame nearly every quantitative problem involving physical or chemical change.

## Dalton's Atomic Theory

John Dalton's atomic theory (1803–1808) is the foundational chemical model that explains how matter combines. It rests on four claims: (1) all matter is composed of indivisible particles called atoms; (2) atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties, while atoms of different elements differ; (3) compounds form when atoms of different elements combine in fixed, small whole-number ratios; and (4) chemical reactions rearrange atoms but never create, destroy, or transmute them.

Dalton did not invent this from pure speculation — he built it to explain two experimental patterns already known in his time: the law of conservation of mass (Lavoisier) and the law of definite proportions (Proust), which showed that a given compound always contains the same elements in the same mass ratio. Dalton added a third pattern, the law of multiple proportions, based on his own analysis of gases: when two elements form more than one compound, the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other stand in a ratio of small whole numbers.

**Worked example.** Carbon and oxygen form two distinct compounds: carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). Suppose 12 g of carbon combines with 16 g of oxygen in one compound and with 32 g of oxygen in the other. Fixing the mass of carbon at 12 g, the oxygen masses are 16 g and 32 g — a ratio of 16:32, or 1:2, a small whole-number ratio. Dalton's theory explains this instantly: one carbon atom bonds with one oxygen atom in CO, and one carbon atom bonds with two oxygen atoms in CO₂. The masses must fall in a whole-number ratio because atoms themselves are indivisible units — you cannot combine "1.37 atoms" of oxygen with one atom of carbon.

**Problem-solving application.** Given mass-ratio data for two compounds of the same two elements, you can test whether they are consistent with atomic theory and even infer their formulas — this is simply the law of multiple proportions applied in reverse. Take iron and chlorine: a fixed mass of 55.85 g of iron combines with two different masses of chlorine, depending on the compound. If compound A has an Fe:Cl mass ratio of 55.85:35.45 and compound B has 55.85:70.90, then comparing the chlorine masses alone gives 35.45:70.90, which reduces to 1:2. That small whole-number ratio tells you compound A must have one Cl atom per Fe atom (FeCl₂-type) and compound B must have twice as many (FeCl₃-type). This is the reasoning tool underlying every empirical-formula and mole-ratio calculation in modern chemistry.

## Atom

An atom is the smallest unit of an element that retains that element's chemical identity. It consists of a dense central **nucleus**, made of positively charged **protons** and neutral **neutrons**, surrounded by negatively charged **electrons** occupying the much larger volume of space around the nucleus. The number of protons—the **atomic number**—defines which element an atom is: every carbon atom has 6 protons, every oxygen atom has 8, and changing that number changes the element itself. Neutrons add mass and stability without changing charge, which is why atoms of the same element can exist as different **isotopes** (e.g., carbon-12 and carbon-14) with the same chemical behavior but different masses. Electrons, arranged in energy levels around the nucleus, determine how an atom interacts with other atoms—this is the basis of nearly all chemistry.

Consider a neutral atom of sodium (Na), atomic number 11. It has 11 protons and, to remain electrically neutral, 11 electrons. Its most common isotope, sodium-23, has 12 neutrons, giving a mass number of 23 (11 protons + 12 neutrons). If this atom loses one electron, it becomes a sodium ion, $\text{Na}^+$, with 11 protons but only 10 electrons—now carrying a net positive charge. Note that losing an electron does not change which element the atom is; identity is fixed by proton count alone.

This distinction becomes a practical problem-solving tool. Suppose you're told an ion has 17 protons, 18 neutrons, and 18 electrons, and asked to identify it. The proton count alone tells you the element: 17 protons means chlorine. The neutron count gives the isotope: mass number $17 + 18 = 35$, so this is chlorine-35. Comparing electrons (18) to protons (17) reveals a charge imbalance of $17 - 18 = -1$, so the species is the chloride ion, $\text{Cl}^-$. This three-step check—protons for identity, protons plus neutrons for mass, protons versus electrons for charge—applies to any atomic or ionic species you encounter, whether in a chemistry problem set or interpreting data from a mass spectrometer, where measured mass and charge are used to work backward to an atom's exact composition.

## Neutron

A neutron is a subatomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom, carrying no electric charge and a mass slightly greater than that of a proton ($1.675 \times 10^{-27}\text{ kg}$, about 1839 times the mass of an electron). Together with protons, neutrons make up the nucleons that account for nearly all of an atom's mass. The number of protons defines which element an atom is, but the number of neutrons can vary — atoms of the same element with different neutron counts are called isotopes.

**Worked example.** Consider carbon. Every carbon atom has 6 protons, which is what makes it carbon. Carbon-12, the most abundant isotope, has 6 neutrons ($6 + 6 = 12$, matching its mass number). Carbon-14, used in radiocarbon dating, has 8 neutrons ($6 + 8 = 14$). Both are chemically identical — they react the same way, because chemistry is governed by electrons and protons — but Carbon-14 is unstable: its nucleus has an unfavorable proton-to-neutron ratio, so it undergoes radioactive decay over time.

**Applying the concept.** Neutron count explains a wide range of practical phenomena. To find the number of neutrons in any isotope, subtract the atomic number (protons) from the mass number: $N = A - Z$. For example, uranium-235 ($Z=92$) has $235 - 92 = 143$ neutrons, while uranium-238 has 146. This three-neutron difference is enormous in consequence: U-235 is fissile and used in nuclear reactors and weapons, while U-238 is not, because the extra neutrons change how the nucleus responds to an incoming neutron strike. Neutrons also drive nuclear fission itself — when a heavy nucleus absorbs a neutron, it can split, releasing energy and additional neutrons that sustain a chain reaction, the basis of both nuclear power and nuclear bombs. In medicine, neutron counts determine which isotopes are radioactive and therefore useful as medical tracers or radiation therapy sources. Practically, whenever you see an isotope notation like $^{14}_{6}\text{C}$, you can immediately extract both its identity and its neutron count, which is often the first step in predicting whether that isotope is stable or will decay.

## Proton

A proton is a subatomic particle carrying one positive elementary charge, $+1.602 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{C}$, and a mass of approximately $1.673 \times 10^{-27}\ \text{kg}$ — roughly 1,836 times heavier than an electron. Protons reside in the atomic nucleus alongside neutrons, bound together by the strong nuclear force, which overcomes the electrostatic repulsion that positively charged protons exert on one another at close range. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus, called the atomic number $Z$, uniquely determines the chemical identity of an element: every carbon atom has exactly 6 protons, every oxygen atom exactly 8, and so on. Because protons are conserved in ordinary chemical reactions, $Z$ never changes when atoms bond, break apart, or rearrange — only nuclear reactions (fission, fusion, radioactive decay) can alter proton count.

Consider a neutral atom of nitrogen, which has $Z = 14$. Since the atom is electrically neutral, it must carry 14 electrons to balance the 14 positive charges from its protons. If this atom loses three electrons to form a nitrogen ion, the proton count stays fixed at 14, but the ion now carries a net charge of $+3$, written $\text{N}^{3+}$. This illustrates a key distinction: protons define what an element *is*, while electrons (which can be gained or lost) determine an atom's ionic charge and much of its chemical behavior.

This distinction becomes a practical tool when identifying atoms and ions from data. Suppose a particle has 17 protons, 18 neutrons, and 18 electrons. The proton count immediately identifies the element as chlorine ($Z = 17$). The mass number, $A = Z + N = 17 + 18 = 35$, tells you this is the chlorine-35 isotope. Comparing protons (17) to electrons (18) shows one extra electron, giving a net charge of $-1$: this is the chloride ion, $^{35}\text{Cl}^-$. Working through such problems — given proton, neutron, and electron counts, determine the element, isotope, and charge — is the core skill built from understanding what a proton represents: the invariant fingerprint of an element, distinct from the variable neutron count (isotopes) and variable electron count (ions) that can change around it.

## Electromagnetic Radiation

Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels through space as coupled oscillating electric and magnetic fields, moving at the speed of light $c \approx 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$ in a vacuum. Unlike sound, it requires no medium — it propagates through empty space, which is how sunlight reaches Earth across 150 million kilometers of vacuum. The radiation is organized by wavelength $\lambda$ and frequency $f$, related by:

$$c = \lambda f$$

Because $c$ is fixed, wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional: stretch the wavelength and the frequency drops, and vice versa. The full range of possible wavelengths — from kilometers-long radio waves to picometer-scale gamma rays — forms the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light occupies a narrow band, roughly 400–700 nm, sandwiched between ultraviolet and infrared.

Higher-frequency radiation (UV, X-rays) is more damaging to biological tissue than lower-frequency radiation (radio, microwave) of the same intensity, because each individual burst of energy it delivers is large enough to break chemical bonds or ionize atoms — a relationship that scales directly with frequency.

**Worked example.** A radio station broadcasts at 101.5 MHz. What is the wavelength of its signal, and how does it compare to visible green light (550 nm)?

Solving $c = \lambda f$ for wavelength:
$$\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8}{1.015 \times 10^8} \approx 2.96 \, \text{m}$$

Green light's frequency, by the same relation, is $f = c/\lambda = (3.00\times10^8)/(550\times10^{-9}) \approx 5.45\times10^{14}$ Hz — nearly seven orders of magnitude higher than the radio signal's 101.5 MHz. Since damage potential tracks frequency, this gap in frequency corresponds to a similarly enormous gap in how forcefully each type of radiation interacts with matter, even though radio waves and green light are both electromagnetic radiation traveling at the same speed $c$.

**Application.** This frequency scaling explains real design and safety decisions: why microwave ovens (2.45 GHz) heat food without ionizing it, why sunscreen targets UV specifically, and why medical X-ray exposure is carefully limited and shielded. When evaluating any electromagnetic source — a cell tower, a tanning bed, an X-ray machine — the diagnostic question is always the same: what is the frequency, and therefore how strongly does this radiation interact with biological tissue?

## Electron

An electron is a subatomic particle carrying a single unit of negative electric charge, approximately $-1.602 \times 10^{-19}\text{ C}$, and a mass of about $9.109 \times 10^{-31}\text{ kg}$ — roughly 1/1836 the mass of a proton. Electrons occupy the space around an atomic nucleus, and their arrangement determines nearly every chemical and electrical property of matter: how atoms bond, how materials conduct electricity, and how light interacts with substances. Unlike a planet orbiting the sun, an electron does not follow a fixed path; quantum mechanics describes its location only probabilistically, in terms of regions called orbitals where it is likely to be found.

**Worked example.** Consider a neutral carbon atom, atomic number 6, meaning it has 6 protons and therefore 6 electrons. These electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy: 2 electrons occupy the innermost shell, and the remaining 4 occupy the second shell. This second-shell arrangement of 4 electrons — not enough to fill the shell, but more than half full — is exactly why carbon can form four bonds with other atoms, making it the backbone of organic chemistry. Contrast this with neon (atomic number 10), whose second shell is completely full with 8 electrons, leaving it chemically inert. The number of outer, or "valence," electrons is the single most predictive fact about how an element behaves.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you are asked to predict whether magnesium (atomic number 12) will tend to lose or gain electrons when forming a compound. Its electron arrangement is 2, 8, 2 — two electrons sit alone in the outermost shell. Removing those two is easier than acquiring six more to fill the shell, so magnesium loses them, forming a $\text{Mg}^{2+}$ ion. This same reasoning — count the valence electrons, then judge whether losing or gaining fewer electrons gets the atom to a full outer shell — lets you predict the charge and reactivity of almost any element on the periodic table, and explains why table salt forms as $\text{Na}^+\text{Cl}^-$ rather than some other combination. This predictive power is what makes the electron, despite its tiny mass, central to chemistry, materials science, and electrical engineering alike.

## Nucleon

A nucleon is a particle found in the nucleus of an atom — specifically, a proton or a neutron. Protons carry a positive electric charge of $+1e$, while neutrons carry no net charge, but the two are nearly identical in mass (roughly $1.67 \times 10^{-27}\,\text{kg}$). The term "nucleon" is simply a convenient label used whenever a calculation or a physical process treats protons and neutrons interchangeably — for instance, when counting the total mass of a nucleus rather than distinguishing which particles carry charge.

**Worked example.** Consider a nucleus of carbon-12, written $^{12}_{6}\text{C}$. The subscript 6 gives the number of protons, and the superscript 12 gives the total nucleon count. The number of neutrons is therefore $12 - 6 = 6$. So carbon-12 contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons — 12 nucleons in total, bound tightly inside a nuclear radius of only a few femtometers ($10^{-15}\,\text{m}$).

**Problem-solving application.** Writing the nucleon count as (protons) + (neutrons) = (total nucleons) gives a simple bookkeeping tool for nuclear reactions: this total, and the total charge, must balance on both sides of any nuclear equation. Suppose uranium-238 ($^{238}_{92}\text{U}$) breaks apart, releasing a small fragment consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons (a helium nucleus, $^{4}_{2}\text{He}$). To find the resulting nucleus left behind, apply conservation of nucleon number and charge:

$$
\text{nucleons remaining} = 238 - 4 = 234, \qquad \text{protons remaining} = 92 - 2 = 90
$$

An atom with 90 protons is thorium, so the leftover nucleus is $^{234}_{90}\text{Th}$. This same nucleon-and-charge bookkeeping applies to any nuclear process — fission, fusion, or the emission of other particles: first identify how many nucleons and how much charge enter and leave, then solve for the unknown quantities on the other side of the equation. Mastering this simple accounting method is often the fastest way to determine an unknown reaction product, without needing to know the detailed physics of the forces that hold the nucleons together in the first place.

## Alpha Particle

An alpha particle is a cluster of two protons and two neutrons bound together and emitted from the nucleus of a heavy, unstable atom during radioactive decay. It is identical in composition to a helium-4 nucleus ($^4_2\text{He}$), carrying a charge of $+2e$ and a mass of about 4 atomic mass units. Alpha emission is one way an unstable nucleus sheds excess mass and energy to move toward a more stable configuration, decreasing its atomic number by 2 and its mass number by 4.

**Worked example.** Consider uranium-238 decaying by alpha emission:

$$^{238}_{92}\text{U} \rightarrow \,^{234}_{90}\text{Th} + \,^{4}_{2}\text{He}$$

Notice that both mass number (238 = 234 + 4) and atomic number (92 = 90 + 2) are conserved — this bookkeeping is the core problem-solving tool for any nuclear decay equation. Given a parent isotope and the type of decay, you can always determine the daughter product by conserving these two quantities. If a student is told that polonium-210 undergoes alpha decay, they can predict the product without memorizing it: subtract 4 from the mass number (210 → 206) and 2 from the atomic number (84 → 82), giving lead-206, $^{206}_{82}\text{Pb}$.

**Problem-solving application.** Alpha particles are large and doubly charged, which makes them interact strongly with matter — they can be stopped by a sheet of paper or a few centimeters of air, losing their energy quickly through collisions with electrons in the material they pass through. This property has practical consequences: alpha emitters are dangerous if inhaled or ingested, where the particle deposits all its energy directly into tissue, but pose little external hazard, since skin or clothing blocks them. This same short range is exploited in smoke detectors, where an alpha source (typically americium-241) knocks electrons off air molecules in a chamber to generate a small steady current; smoke particles disrupt this current, triggering the alarm. When solving problems involving radiation shielding or dose calculations, always start by identifying the particle type, since alpha, beta, and gamma radiation differ enormously in penetration and biological effect despite sometimes carrying comparable energy.

## Beta Particle

A beta particle is a high-speed electron (or, less commonly, a positron) emitted from an atomic nucleus during radioactive decay. It arises when a neutron converts into a proton, releasing an electron and an antineutrino ($\beta^-$ decay), or when a proton converts into a neutron, releasing a positron and a neutrino ($\beta^+$ decay). The defining nuclear equation for $\beta^-$ decay is:

$$
{}^A_Z X \rightarrow {}^A_{Z+1} Y + {}^0_{-1}e^- + \bar{\nu}_e
$$

Notice that the mass number $A$ stays the same while the atomic number $Z$ increases by one — the element identity changes, but the total number of nucleons is conserved. This conservation of mass number and charge is what makes nuclear equations solvable: whatever numbers go in on the left must balance on the right.

**Worked example**: Carbon-14, used in radiocarbon dating, undergoes $\beta^-$ decay. Starting with ${}^{14}_6\text{C}$, a neutron converts to a proton, so $Z$ increases from 6 to 7 while $A$ remains 14. The product is nitrogen-14:

$$
{}^{14}_6\text{C} \rightarrow {}^{14}_7\text{N} + {}^0_{-1}e^- + \bar{\nu}_e
$$

You can verify this balance the same way you'd balance a chemical equation: sum the superscripts (14 = 14 + 0) and sum the subscripts (6 = 7 + (–1)).

**Problem-solving application**: Suppose a nuclide ${}^{40}_{19}\text{K}$ (potassium-40) undergoes $\beta^-$ decay. To find the daughter product, apply the same conservation rules: $A$ stays at 40, and $Z$ increases from 19 to 20, giving calcium-40 (${}^{40}_{20}\text{Ca}$). This technique — holding $A$ fixed and incrementing $Z$ by one — lets you predict decay products for any $\beta^-$ emitter without memorizing decay chains individually. (For $\beta^+$ decay, the same logic applies with $Z$ decreasing by one instead.)

Beta particles also matter practically because of their penetrating power: unlike alpha particles, which are stopped by paper or skin, beta particles require a few millimeters of aluminum or plastic shielding to block, a distinction that governs radiation safety protocols in medical imaging, nuclear power plants, and industrial gauging equipment.

## Gamma Ray

A gamma ray is a photon of electromagnetic radiation with the highest energy and shortest wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum — typically above 100 keV, with wavelengths shorter than about $10^{-11}$ meters. Like all electromagnetic radiation, a gamma ray carries energy $E$ related to its frequency $f$ by the Planck relation $E = hf$, where $h$ is Planck's constant. What distinguishes gamma rays from X-rays of similar energy is not the physics of the photon itself but its origin: gamma rays are emitted from the nucleus of an atom during radioactive decay or nuclear reactions, while X-rays arise from electron transitions or deceleration outside the nucleus. Because they carry so much energy per photon, gamma rays are classified as ionizing radiation — capable of knocking electrons out of atoms and breaking chemical bonds, including DNA strands.

**Worked example.** Consider cobalt-60, a radioactive isotope used in medical sterilization and cancer therapy. It decays by emitting a gamma ray with energy 1.33 MeV. Converting to joules: $1.33 \times 10^6 \text{ eV} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV} \approx 2.13 \times 10^{-13}$ J. Using $E = hf$, the frequency is $f = E/h \approx (2.13\times10^{-13})/(6.63\times10^{-34}) \approx 3.2\times10^{20}$ Hz — far beyond visible light's $\sim 10^{14}$ Hz, explaining why gamma rays penetrate matter that blocks ordinary light.

**Problem-solving application.** Gamma-ray attenuation follows an exponential law: $I = I_0 e^{-\mu x}$, where $I_0$ is initial intensity, $\mu$ is the material's linear attenuation coefficient, and $x$ is thickness. Suppose a hospital needs to reduce gamma intensity from a cobalt-60 source to 1% of its original value using lead, where $\mu = 0.5\ \text{cm}^{-1}$ at this energy. Solving $0.01 = e^{-0.5x}$ gives $x = \ln(100)/0.5 \approx 9.2$ cm of lead shielding. This kind of calculation — choosing shielding thickness, estimating dose from a known source, or comparing materials by their attenuation coefficients — is exactly the applied reasoning used in radiology, nuclear power plant design, and space-mission radiation shielding, where gamma rays from cosmic sources threaten both electronics and astronauts.

## Ionizing Radiation

**Definition.** Ionizing radiation is any energetic particle or electromagnetic wave capable of knocking electrons out of atoms or molecules, converting them into charged ions. This matters because ionization can break chemical bonds — including the bonds in DNA — in ways that ordinary heat or light cannot. Radiation is ionizing only above a threshold energy (roughly 10 eV per photon or particle), which is why ultraviolet light near that boundary is weakly ionizing, while visible light, radio waves, and microwaves are not. The main types are alpha particles (helium nuclei), beta particles (fast electrons), gamma rays and X-rays (high-energy photons), and neutrons. They differ enormously in penetrating power: alpha particles stop within a sheet of paper or the outer layer of skin, beta particles need a few millimeters of plastic or aluminum, while gamma rays require thick lead or concrete.

**Worked example.** Radiation dose to living tissue is measured in sieverts (Sv), which weight the absorbed energy by how biologically damaging each radiation type is. A chest X-ray delivers about 0.1 mSv; a full-body CT scan delivers roughly 10 mSv; natural background radiation totals about 3 mSv per year for an average person. Suppose a technician receives 5 CT-scan-equivalent doses in a year for work. Total dose: $5 \times 10\ \text{mSv} = 50\ \text{mSv}$. Comparing this to the U.S. occupational annual limit of 50 mSv shows the technician is right at the regulatory ceiling — a case where simple dose accounting directly informs a safety decision.

**Problem-solving application.** Radiation safety follows the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable), operationalized through three levers: time, distance, and shielding. Dose is roughly proportional to exposure time and inversely proportional to the square of distance from a point source (the inverse-square law), since radiation spreads over an expanding sphere. If a worker doubles their distance from a source, exposure drops to one-fourth; halving the time in the area halves the dose again. A hospital designing an X-ray room, for instance, combines lead-lined walls (shielding), positioning staff behind barriers (distance), and minimizing scan time (time) to keep occupational doses well under limits. This same three-lever framework applies broadly — from nuclear plant design to interpreting airport-scanner or radon-exposure debates — making ionizing radiation a concept where quantitative reasoning translates directly into real safety decisions.

## Radiation Biological Effects

Ionizing radiation damages living tissue primarily by breaking chemical bonds in DNA, either directly or by ionizing water molecules to produce reactive free radicals that then attack the DNA strand. The biological consequences depend on the *absorbed dose* (energy deposited per unit mass, measured in grays, Gy) and the *equivalent dose*, which weights the absorbed dose by the radiation's relative biological effectiveness and is measured in sieverts (Sv): $H = D \times w_R$, where $D$ is absorbed dose and $w_R$ is a radiation weighting factor (1 for X-rays and gamma rays, up to 20 for alpha particles, which cause dense, localized ionization tracks).

Effects fall into two categories. *Deterministic effects* (radiation burns, acute radiation sickness, cataracts) have a threshold dose below which they do not occur, and severity increases with dose above that threshold — a dose-response relationship similar to a toxin. *Stochastic effects* (cancer, heritable mutations) have no known threshold; instead, the *probability* of the effect increases with dose while its severity does not, since a single damaged cell can eventually become a cancer.

Worked example: A radiology technician receives a whole-body absorbed dose of 2 mGy from scattered X-rays during a shift, working 250 days per year. Since X-rays have $w_R = 1$, the equivalent dose per shift is 2 mSv... wait — 2 mGy converts to 2 mSv directly. Annual dose = $2\text{ mSv} \times 250 = 500\text{ mSv}$, far above the U.S. occupational limit of 50 mSv/year, signaling a shielding or scheduling problem, not an acceptable exposure.

Problem-solving application: Regulatory limits use the *linear no-threshold (LNT) model* to estimate stochastic risk at low doses, extrapolating from data at higher doses (e.g., atomic bomb survivors) down to zero, since a true threshold cannot be measured directly at low doses. Applying LNT, if a population dose of 100 person-Sv is estimated to cause 5 excess cancers, then a facility contributing 10 person-Sv should be budgeted to contribute roughly 0.5 excess cancer cases — a linear scaling used in cost-benefit and ALARA ("as low as reasonably achievable") planning, even though the model's validity at very low individual doses remains scientifically debated.

## Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy treats cancer by directing high-energy radiation—photons, protons, or electrons—at tumor tissue to damage the DNA of cancer cells beyond repair. Cancer cells divide rapidly and have weaker DNA-repair machinery than most healthy cells, so a carefully chosen radiation dose kills a larger fraction of tumor cells than of surrounding normal tissue. The central engineering and medical challenge is not delivering radiation—that part is straightforward—but concentrating the dose on the tumor while sparing nearby organs, since radiation damage is cumulative and healthy-tissue tolerance is limited.

**Worked example.** Suppose a tumor requires a total dose of 60 Gy (gray, the unit of absorbed radiation energy per kilogram of tissue) to achieve a high probability of destruction, but a single dose that large would also destroy adjacent healthy tissue and cause severe side effects. Clinicians solve this by *fractionation*: splitting the total dose into smaller daily doses (e.g., 2 Gy/day for 30 days). Healthy cells recover between fractions faster than cancer cells do, so repeated sublethal doses accumulate lethal damage preferentially in the tumor. A second strategy is *conformal delivery*: using multiple radiation beams aimed from different angles, all converging on the tumor. Each beam's path through healthy tissue receives only a fraction of the dose, while the tumor—sitting at the intersection of all beams—receives the full sum. If five beams each deliver 12 Gy to the tumor but only 2–3 Gy to the tissue they individually pass through, the tumor accumulates 60 Gy while no single healthy region exceeds a tolerable dose.

**Problem-solving application.** Treatment planning is essentially a geometric and dosimetric optimization problem: given a tumor's shape, location, and proximity to critical organs (e.g., the spinal cord or a lung), planners choose beam angles, intensities, and fractionation schedules to maximize tumor dose while keeping every nearby organ below its known damage threshold. Modern techniques like intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) go further, varying the beam's intensity across its cross-section so that even irregularly shaped tumors wrapped around sensitive structures can be targeted precisely. Understanding radiation therapy this way—as a constrained optimization between "enough dose to kill the tumor" and "not too much dose to any single healthy region"—clarifies why treatment plans differ so much between patients even for tumors of similar size: the surrounding anatomy, not just the tumor itself, determines the achievable trade-off.

## Payoff

Everything this concept-book has built — modeling, optimization, statistical inference, spatial reasoning — converges in radiation therapy because it is a problem that cannot be solved by any single tool alone. A tumor must be destroyed while the tissue surrounding it, often only millimeters away, must survive. This is not a metaphorical tension; it is a literal optimization problem, solved daily in hospitals, in which a beam of radiation is shaped, aimed, and dosed so that the cumulative energy deposited inside the tumor volume is lethal while the energy deposited in healthy organs stays below a survivable threshold. Radiation therapy is the natural endpoint of this book because it is where geometry, dosimetry, and decision-making under constraints all have to work simultaneously and correctly — a single miscalculation is not an inconvenience but a clinical harm.

The connection to spatial and vector reasoning is direct: treatment planning represents the tumor and surrounding organs as three-dimensional regions, and beam paths as vectors intersecting those regions, so that dose can be computed as an integral of exposure along each path. The connection to optimization is equally direct: planners solve a constrained optimization problem, choosing beam angles, intensities, and the number of beams to maximize tumor dose subject to upper bounds on dose to nearby organs — exactly the kind of linear and nonlinear programming introduced earlier in this book, now applied to save a life rather than to abstractly minimize a cost function. The connection to probability and statistics appears in how treatment plans are validated: dose distributions carry uncertainty from patient movement, machine calibration, and biological response, and clinicians must reason about risk in terms of probability of tumor control versus probability of complication, not certainties.

What makes radiation therapy the fitting capstone is that it forces every concept to answer to a real consequence. A model that is elegant but imprecise, an optimization that is fast but infeasible to deliver with real equipment, a statistic that is accurate on average but ignores a rare but catastrophic outcome — none of these are acceptable in this domain. That is the deepest lesson this book has been building toward: mathematics is not complete until it is trustworthy enough to act on.

From here, you are equipped to explore how radiation treatment planning is actually optimized in practice — how hospitals formulate and solve the beam-angle and dose-constraint problem computationally, and what happens when the optimizer's solution meets the limits of real machines and real patients.

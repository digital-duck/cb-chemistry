## Matter

**Definition.** In classical physics, *matter* is any substance that possesses mass and occupies volume, thereby exhibiting inertia and interacting through gravitational and electromagnetic forces. Formally, a body of matter is characterized by a mass density function $\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$, defined so that the total mass in a region $V$ is

$$
m = \int_V \rho(\mathbf{r}, t)\, dV.
$$

Matter is distinguished from massless fields (such as electromagnetic radiation in vacuum) by satisfying $\rho > 0$ almost everywhere in its occupied domain, and by obeying conservation of mass, expressed locally via the continuity equation.

**Worked example.** Consider a thin rod of length $L$ with linear mass density $\lambda(x) = \lambda_0\left(1 + \dfrac{x}{L}\right)$ for $x \in [0, L]$. The total mass is

$$
m = \int_0^L \lambda_0\left(1 + \frac{x}{L}\right) dx = \lambda_0\left[x + \frac{x^2}{2L}\right]_0^L = \frac{3}{2}\lambda_0 L.
$$

This illustrates how the abstract definition of matter as mass-bearing substance reduces to an integral computation once a density function is specified.

**Key theorem (Conservation of Mass).** For a closed system with no mass flux across its boundary $\partial V$, the total mass is conserved:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\int_V \rho\, dV = -\oint_{\partial V} \rho\, \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{n}\, dA = 0,
$$

which follows from the divergence theorem applied to the continuity equation $\partial_t \rho + \nabla\cdot(\rho\mathbf{v}) = 0$.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

x, L, lam0 = sp.symbols('x L lambda_0', positive=True)
lam = lam0 * (1 + x/L)
mass = sp.integrate(lam, (x, 0, L))
print(sp.simplify(mass))  # 3*L*lambda_0/2
```

## Measurement

**Definition.** A *measurement* is a function $m: \mathcal{Q} \to \mathbb{R} \times U$ that assigns to a physical quantity $q \in \mathcal{Q}$ a numerical value $x \in \mathbb{R}$ together with a unit $u \in U$, such that the pair $(x, u)$ satisfies the invariance condition $m(q) = (x, u) \implies m(q) = (\lambda x, u/\lambda)$ for any positive scale factor $\lambda$ applied consistently to both the quantity and the unit. This invariance formalizes the intuitive requirement that a length is "5 meters" regardless of whether we choose to express it as "500 centimeters" — the underlying physical quantity is unchanged, only its numerical representation shifts.

**Worked example.** Suppose a rod has length $q$ such that $m(q) = (5, \text{m})$. Converting to centimeters, $\lambda = 100$, so $m(q) = (5 \cdot 100, \text{m}/100) = (500, \text{cm})$. Both expressions denote the same physical length, illustrating that measurement values are unit-dependent but the underlying quantity is unit-independent.

**Key theorem (Dimensional Consistency).** If $f(q_1, \ldots, q_n)$ is a physically meaningful function relating measured quantities, then $f$ must be expressible in a form invariant under simultaneous, consistent rescaling of all units — this is the content of the Buckingham $\pi$ theorem, which guarantees that any such relation can be rewritten in terms of dimensionless products $\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_k$.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational

# Convert 5 meters to centimeters
x, lam = symbols('x lambda', positive=True)
value_m = 5
lam_val = 100  # scale factor: 1 m = 100 cm

value_cm = value_m * lam_val
print(f"{value_m} m = {value_cm} cm")  # 5 m = 500 cm
```

## Physical Property

**Definition.** A *physical property* is a real-valued function $Q$ that assigns to a physical system a numerical value, expressed in a chosen unit system, which can in principle be measured or derived from measurement without altering the chemical identity of the system. If a system's condition is described by measurable quantities such as mass, volume, and temperature, a physical property is any well-defined function $Q$ of those quantities.

**Worked example.** Consider a sample of gas of mass $m$ occupying volume $V$ at temperature $T$. Density $\rho = m/V$ is a physical property: it is measurable (via mass and volume determinations), it does not depend on how much gas you happen to have sampled (it is *intensive*), and it transforms consistently under unit changes, e.g., $\rho\,[\mathrm{kg/m^3}] = 1000\,\rho\,[\mathrm{g/cm^3}]$. Contrast this with mass $m$ itself, an *extensive* property that scales with system size.

**Key theorem (Intensive–Extensive Decomposition).** Every physical property $Q$ of a homogeneous system can be classified as extensive or intensive: $Q$ is extensive if $Q(\lambda S) = \lambda\, Q(S)$ for all scaling factors $\lambda > 0$ (where $\lambda S$ denotes $\lambda$ copies of the system), and intensive if $Q(\lambda S) = Q(S)$. Any extensive property $Q$ can be converted to an intensive one by dividing by another extensive property, typically mass or volume, e.g., $\rho = m/V$.

*Proof sketch.* Partition the homogeneous system into $\lambda$ identical subsystems. Extensive quantities (mass, volume, internal energy) sum additively across subsystems, giving the scaling law $Q(\lambda S) = \lambda Q(S)$. Intensive quantities (density, temperature, pressure) are determined locally and are unaffected by the number of subsystems, yielding $Q(\lambda S) = Q(S)$. $\blacksquare$

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

m, V, lam = sp.symbols('m V lambda', positive=True)
rho = m / V

rho_scaled = rho.subs({m: lam*m, V: lam*V})
print(sp.simplify(rho_scaled - rho))  # 0  -> confirms rho is intensive
```

## Si Units

**Definition.** The International System of Units (SI) is the coherent system of measurement built from seven base units, each defined by a fixed numerical value of a fundamental physical constant: the second ($s$, via the cesium hyperfine transition frequency $\Delta\nu_{Cs}$), the meter ($m$, via the speed of light $c$), the kilogram ($kg$, via the Planck constant $h$), the ampere ($A$, via the elementary charge $e$), the kelvin ($K$, via the Boltzmann constant $k_B$), the mole ($mol$, via the Avogadro constant $N_A$), and the candela ($cd$, via luminous efficacy $K_{cd}$). All other physical quantities are expressed as derived units, dimensionally coherent products of powers of these seven, with no numerical conversion factor required.

**Worked example.** Consider force, defined by Newton's second law $F = ma$. Dimensionally, $[F] = [m][a] = kg \cdot m \cdot s^{-2}$, which defines the derived unit newton: $1\,N = 1\,kg\,m\,s^{-2}$. To verify dimensional consistency in an equation such as kinetic energy $E_k = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$, substitute units: $[m][v]^2 = kg \cdot (m\,s^{-1})^2 = kg\,m^2\,s^{-2} = N\cdot m$, which is precisely a force acting over a distance, confirming that the expression is dimensionally sound without introducing any further named unit.

**Key theorem (Dimensional Homogeneity).** Any physically meaningful equation relating quantities must be dimensionally homogeneous: every additive term must reduce to the same combination of base-unit exponents. This principle underlies dimensional analysis throughout physics and engineering: if a proposed relation among quantities fails to balance in base-unit exponents on both sides, it cannot describe a physical law, regardless of how the numerical coefficients are chosen.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp
from sympy.physics.units import kg, m, s, N, convert_to

mass, accel = 2*kg, 3*m/s**2
force = mass * accel
print(convert_to(force, N))       # 6*newton

velocity = 4*m/s
energy = sp.Rational(1,2) * mass * velocity**2
print(convert_to(energy, N*m))    # 16*meter*newton
```

## Intensive Property

**Definition.** A physical property $P$ of a thermodynamic system is called *intensive* if its value does not depend on the extent (size or mass) of the system. Formally, suppose a homogeneous system is partitioned into two subsystems with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, each in the same thermodynamic state as the whole. If $P$ satisfies
$$
P(\lambda \, m) = P(m), \qquad \lambda > 0,
$$
then $P$ is intensive. This contrasts with an *extensive* property $E$, which scales linearly with system size, $E(\lambda m) = \lambda\, E(m)$. Common intensive properties include temperature $T$, pressure $p$, density $\rho$, and specific quantities such as molar volume $\bar v = V/n$.

**Worked example.** Consider a container of water at uniform temperature $T = 25^{\circ}\text{C}$ and density $\rho = 997\ \text{kg/m}^3$. If the container is divided into two equal halves, each half still has $T = 25^{\circ}\text{C}$ and $\rho = 997\ \text{kg/m}^3$ — these values are unchanged by halving the mass. In contrast, the total volume $V$ and total mass $m$ are each halved, confirming that $V$ and $m$ are extensive while $T$ and $\rho$ are intensive.

**Key theorem.** If $E$ is an extensive property that is a homogeneous function of degree 1 in the extensive variables $\{n_i\}$ (mole numbers) at fixed intensive variables, Euler's theorem gives
$$
E(n_1, \dots, n_k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial n_i}\right)_{T,p,n_{j\neq i}},
$$
where each partial molar derivative $\bar{e}_i = \left(\partial E/\partial n_i\right)$ is itself intensive. This identity underlies the definition of chemical potential and partial molar quantities in chemical thermodynamics.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

n, V_m = sp.symbols('n V_m', positive=True)   # V_m: molar volume (intensive)
V = n * V_m                                    # total volume (extensive)

lam = sp.symbols('lambda', positive=True)
scaled = V.subs(n, lam*n)
print(sp.simplify(scaled / V))                 # -> lambda, confirms V is extensive
print(sp.simplify(V_m.subs(n, lam*n) / V_m))   # -> 1, confirms V_m is intensive
```

## Dimensional Analysis

**Definition.** Every physical quantity $Q$ can be expressed as a product of powers of fundamental dimensions—typically mass $\mathsf{M}$, length $\mathsf{L}$, and time $\mathsf{T}$—written as a *dimensional formula* $[Q] = \mathsf{M}^a \mathsf{L}^b \mathsf{T}^c$. Dimensional analysis is the study of relationships among physical quantities by tracking these exponents, independent of the numerical values or units chosen (SI, CGS, etc.). A valid physical equation must be *dimensionally homogeneous*: every additive term must carry the same dimensional formula.

**Worked example.** Consider the period $T$ of a simple pendulum, hypothesized to depend on its length $\ell$, mass $m$, and gravitational acceleration $g$. Assume $T = k\, \ell^a m^b g^c$ for some dimensionless constant $k$. Substituting dimensions—$[T]=\mathsf{T}$, $[\ell]=\mathsf{L}$, $[m]=\mathsf{M}$, $[g]=\mathsf{L}\mathsf{T}^{-2}$—gives
$$\mathsf{T} = \mathsf{L}^a \mathsf{M}^b (\mathsf{L}\mathsf{T}^{-2})^c = \mathsf{L}^{a+c}\mathsf{M}^b\mathsf{T}^{-2c}.$$
Matching exponents: $b=0$ (mass), $-2c=1 \Rightarrow c=-\tfrac12$, and $a+c=0 \Rightarrow a=\tfrac12$. Thus $T = k\sqrt{\ell/g}$, recovering the correct functional form without solving the pendulum's differential equation.

**Key theorem (Buckingham $\pi$ theorem).** If a physical relation among $n$ variables involves $r$ independent fundamental dimensions, the relation can be rewritten equivalently in terms of $n-r$ dimensionless groups $\pi_1, \dots, \pi_{n-r}$. This theorem guarantees that dimensional analysis, though it cannot determine dimensionless constants like $k$, always reduces the complexity of a physical law by exactly $r$ parameters.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational, solve, Eq

a, b, c = symbols('a b c')
# [T]=T, [l]=L, [m]=M, [g]=L*T^-2
eqs = [Eq(b, 0), Eq(-2*c, 1), Eq(a + c, 0)]
sol = solve(eqs, [a, b, c])
print(sol)  # {a: -1/2... solved as a=1/2 via a+c=0}
```

## Temperature

**Definition.** Temperature is a scalar quantity that measures the average kinetic energy of the particles composing a system, serving as the empirical basis for thermal equilibrium. Two systems in thermal contact exchange no net heat if and only if they share the same temperature — a statement known as the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics. Formally, if $T_A = T_B$ and $T_B = T_C$, then $T_A = T_C$; this equivalence relation permits temperature to be assigned a consistent numerical scale via a thermometric device.

**Worked example.** Consider an ideal gas confined to a container of volume $V$ containing $N$ particles. The ideal gas law relates pressure $p$, volume $V$, and temperature $T$:
$$
pV = Nk_BT,
$$
where $k_B \approx 1.380649 \times 10^{-23}\ \text{J/K}$ is Boltzmann's constant. If $N = 6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles occupy $V = 22.4\ \text{L}$ at $p = 1\ \text{atm} = 1.013 \times 10^5\ \text{Pa}$, solving for $T$ gives $T \approx 273.15\ \text{K}$, the freezing point of water.

**Key theorem (Equipartition of Energy).** For a classical system in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$, each quadratic degree of freedom in the energy contributes an average energy of $\tfrac{1}{2}k_BT$. Consequently, a monatomic ideal gas with three translational degrees of freedom has mean kinetic energy per particle
$$
\langle E \rangle = \tfrac{3}{2}k_BT.
$$
The proof sketch follows from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution: integrating $\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$ weighted by the Boltzmann factor $e^{-mv^2/2k_BT}$ over velocity space yields the stated result via Gaussian integrals.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

p, V, N, kB, T = sp.symbols('p V N k_B T', positive=True)
ideal_gas_law = sp.Eq(p*V, N*kB*T)
T_solution = sp.solve(ideal_gas_law, T)[0]
print(T_solution)  # N*k_B*T = p*V  ->  T = p*V/(N*k_B)
```

## Temperature Scale Conversion

**Definition.** A temperature scale assigns a real number to a thermal state via an affine map fixed by two reference points. The Celsius scale $C$ and Fahrenheit scale $F$ are related by the affine transformation
$$
F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32, \qquad C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32).
$$
The Kelvin scale $K$, used in thermodynamics, is a shifted version of Celsius with no affine slope adjustment:
$$
K = C + 273.15.
$$
Because $K$ is an absolute scale, $K \geq 0$ for all physical temperatures, with $K = 0$ corresponding to absolute zero.

**Worked example.** Convert $98.6^\circ\text{F}$ (normal human body temperature) to Celsius and Kelvin. Using the inverse relation,
$$
C = \frac{5}{9}(98.6 - 32) = \frac{5}{9}(66.6) = 37.0^\circ\text{C}.
$$
Then $K = 37.0 + 273.15 = 310.15\ \text{K}$.

**Key theorem.** *The Celsius-to-Fahrenheit map $\phi(C) = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$ is a bijective affine function on $\mathbb{R}$, hence invertible, with a unique fixed point at $C = F = -40$.*

*Proof sketch.* Since $\phi$ has nonzero slope $\frac{9}{5} \neq 0$, it is strictly increasing and therefore injective; affine maps with nonzero slope are surjective onto $\mathbb{R}$, giving bijectivity. The inverse is $\phi^{-1}(F) = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)$, obtained by solving $F = \frac{9}{5}C+32$ for $C$. A fixed point satisfies $\phi(C) = C$, i.e., $C = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$, giving $-\frac{4}{5}C = 32$, so $C = -40$. $\blacksquare$

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational

C, F, K = symbols('C F K')

# Define conversions
F_expr = Rational(9, 5) * C + 32
C_expr = Rational(5, 9) * (F - 32)
K_expr = C + Rational(27315, 100)

# Verify fixed point
fixed_point = solve(Eq(F_expr, C), C)
print("Fixed point (C = F):", fixed_point)  # [-40]

# Convert 98.6 F to Celsius and Kelvin
c_val = C_expr.subs(F, Rational(986, 10))
k_val = K_expr.subs(C, c_val)
print("Celsius:", float(c_val))   # 37.0
print("Kelvin:", float(k_val))    # 310.15
```

## Payoff

Temperature scale conversion is the concept that finally forces a student to confront the difference between a *quantity* and its *representation*. A temperature is a physical state of a system, but the number we write down to describe it — $32$, $0$, or $273.15$ — depends entirely on an arbitrary choice of zero point and unit size. The conversion formulas

$$
F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32, \qquad K = C + 273.15
$$

are affine maps: linear rescalings composed with a translation. This is the natural endpoint of the book because it is the simplest possible instance of a general and recurring idea — that measurement is mediated by a coordinate system, and that meaningful physical laws must be expressible in a form that is invariant, or at least transformable in a known way, under change of coordinates. Everything built earlier — functions, linear equations, function composition and inversion — collapses here into a single, tangible, checkable computation.

The connections to downstream applications are direct. In unit conversion generally (currency, distance, mass), the same affine-map structure recurs: a scale factor and, sometimes, an offset. In data normalization for statistics and machine learning, standardizing a variable via $z = (x - \mu)/\sigma$ is structurally identical to converting Celsius to Fahrenheit — a shift followed by a rescale. In physics and thermodynamics, recognizing that $K$, not $C$, is the scale in which absolute-zero-dependent laws (such as the ideal gas law $PV = nRT$) take their simplest form shows why choosing the right coordinate system is not cosmetic but essential to correct reasoning. In software engineering, writing a robust `celsius_to_fahrenheit` function that handles edge cases (absolute zero, invalid inputs) is a first exercise in defensive, well-specified code.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**

```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational, solve, Eq

C, F, K = symbols('C F K', real=True)

f_to_c = Eq(F, Rational(9,5)*C + 32)
k_to_c = Eq(K, C + Rational(27315,100))

print(solve(f_to_c, C))   # invert F(C) to get C(F)
print(solve(k_to_c, C))   # invert K(C) to get C(K)
print(f_to_c.subs(C, 0))  # verify: 0°C = 32°F
```

You now hold the tool to move fluently between representations of the same underlying reality. Which application calls to you first — tracing how the ideal gas law breaks down if you forget to convert to Kelvin, or building a small library of unit-conversion functions and testing it against known reference points?

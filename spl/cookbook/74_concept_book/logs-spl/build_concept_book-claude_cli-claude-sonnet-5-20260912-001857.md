## Covalent Bonding

A covalent bond forms when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons, allowing each atom to attain a more stable, lower-energy electron configuration—typically a full outer shell of eight electrons (the octet rule) or two electrons for hydrogen. Unlike ionic bonding, where electrons transfer completely from one atom to another, covalent bonding involves electrons occupying a shared region of space between the two nuclei. This shared electron pair is attracted simultaneously to both nuclei, and that mutual attraction is what holds the atoms together.

Consider the formation of a chlorine molecule, $\text{Cl}_2$. Each chlorine atom has seven valence electrons and needs one more to complete its octet. Neither atom can simply take an electron from the other, since both have the same electronegativity. Instead, each contributes one electron to a shared pair, so both atoms effectively "count" eight electrons around themselves. The result is a single covalent bond, written $\text{Cl-Cl}$.

When solving structural problems, the key skill is determining how many bonds and lone pairs a molecule needs. A reliable method is to count total valence electrons across all atoms, then distribute them to give every atom (except hydrogen) an octet, using shared pairs for bonds and remaining pairs as lone pairs on individual atoms. Applying this to $\text{Cl}_2$: two chlorine atoms contribute seven electrons each, for a total of fourteen. One pair (two electrons) forms the shared bond between the atoms, leaving twelve electrons—six on each chlorine—distributed as three lone pairs per atom. Checking the result, each chlorine atom is now surrounded by eight electrons: two from the shared bond and six from its own lone pairs, satisfying the octet rule and confirming the structure is correct.

This bookkeeping approach—counting electrons, then assigning bonds and lone pairs to satisfy each atom's stability requirement—generalizes directly to more complex molecules with multiple atoms, multiple bonds, or double and triple bonds, and is the practical foundation for predicting molecular structure, which in turn determines a molecule's shape, polarity, and reactivity in later topics such as VSEPR theory and intermolecular forces.

## Electronegativity

Electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom attracts the shared electrons in a chemical bond toward itself. It is not a directly measurable physical quantity like mass or charge; rather, it is a comparative scale, built from bond energies, that lets chemists predict how electron density will be distributed when two atoms bond. The most widely used scale, developed by Linus Pauling, assigns dimensionless values ranging from about 0.7 (cesium) to 4.0 (fluorine). Across a period, electronegativity increases from left to right as nuclear charge grows while atomic radius shrinks, pulling bonding electrons closer to the nucleus. Down a group, electronegativity decreases as atomic radius increases and outer electrons sit farther from the nucleus, shielded by inner electron shells.

**Worked example.** Consider the bond in HCl. Chlorine's electronegativity is 3.16, hydrogen's is 2.20. The difference, $\Delta\chi = 3.16 - 2.20 = 0.96$, is large enough to make the bond polar covalent: chlorine pulls the shared electron pair toward itself, creating a partial negative charge ($\delta^-$) on Cl and a partial positive charge ($\delta^+$) on H. Compare this to the C–H bond in methane, where $\Delta\chi = 2.55 - 2.20 = 0.35$ — small enough that the bond is treated as essentially nonpolar.

**Problem-solving application.** Electronegativity differences let you predict both bond type and molecular behavior without running an experiment. As a rule of thumb: $\Delta\chi < 0.5$ indicates a nonpolar covalent bond, $0.5 \le \Delta\chi < 1.7$ indicates a polar covalent bond, and $\Delta\chi \ge 1.7$ indicates a bond that is predominantly ionic. Apply this to NaCl: $\chi_{\text{Cl}} - \chi_{\text{Na}} = 3.16 - 0.93 = 2.23$, correctly predicting an ionic bond. This same logic extends to predicting molecular polarity: in CO$_2$, each C=O bond is polar ($\Delta\chi = 3.44 - 2.55 = 0.89$), but the linear geometry causes the two bond dipoles to cancel, making the overall molecule nonpolar — a reminder that electronegativity predicts bond polarity, while molecular polarity also depends on geometry. This combined reasoning is essential for predicting solubility, boiling points, and reactivity patterns across organic and inorganic chemistry.

## Periodic Table Groups

**Definition.** The periodic table arranges the 118 known elements into rows (periods) and columns (groups, or families). Elements in the same group share the same number of valence electrons — the electrons in the outermost occupied shell — which is why they display similar chemical behavior. For example, Group 1 (the alkali metals: Li, Na, K, ...) each have one valence electron and react vigorously with water; Group 17 (the halogens: F, Cl, Br, ...) each have seven valence electrons and readily gain one more to complete a stable octet. Group 18 (the noble gases) have a full valence shell and are chemically inert under most conditions. This organization is not arbitrary bookkeeping — it reflects the quantum-mechanical structure of electron shells, so knowing an element's group tells you a great deal about its reactivity, bonding tendencies, and physical properties without memorizing each element individually.

**Worked example.** Suppose you're asked to predict the formula of the compound formed between magnesium (Mg, Group 2) and chlorine (Cl, Group 17). Mg has 2 valence electrons and tends to lose both to reach a stable configuration, forming Mg$^{2+}$. Cl has 7 valence electrons and tends to gain 1 to form Cl$^-$. To balance charge, you need two Cl$^-$ ions for every Mg$^{2+}$ ion, giving the formula MgCl$_2$. This is exactly the reasoning chemists use before ever running an experiment — group position alone predicts the ionic charge and, from there, the compound's stoichiometry.

**Problem-solving application.** Group position is a diagnostic tool. Given an unfamiliar element, you can locate its group to predict: (1) its likely ionic charge (Group 1 → +1, Group 2 → +2, Group 16 → −2, Group 17 → −1), (2) whether it will form compounds with a given partner and in what ratio, and (3) trends like reactivity (increasing down Group 1, decreasing down Group 17) or atomic size (increasing down any group). For instance, to predict the formula for the compound between aluminum (Group 13, forms Al$^{3+}$) and oxygen (Group 16, forms O$^{2-}$), find the least common multiple of the charges (6), requiring 2 Al and 3 O: Al$_2$O$_3$. Practicing this charge-balancing method across many group pairs builds the same predictive fluency a chemist uses when encountering a new reaction.

## Nonmetals

Nonmetals are elements that generally lack the properties characteristic of metals: they are poor conductors of heat and electricity, tend to be brittle or soft rather than malleable, and — with the exception of carbon in some forms — are not lustrous. On the periodic table, nonmetals occupy the upper right region, including hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine), and the noble gases. Chemically, nonmetals tend to gain or share electrons rather than lose them, because their atoms have relatively high electronegativity and hold their valence electrons tightly. This behavior distinguishes them sharply from metals, which tend to lose electrons and form cations.

Consider oxygen and sulfur, both nonmetals in Group 16. When oxygen reacts with a metal like magnesium, it gains two electrons to form the oxide ion, $O^{2-}$, while magnesium loses two electrons to form $Mg^{2+}$, producing the ionic compound $MgO$. But when two nonmetals react with each other, neither has enough of an electronegativity advantage to fully strip electrons from the other. Instead, they share electron pairs, forming covalent bonds — as seen in water ($H_2O$), carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), and ammonia ($NH_3$).

This gain-or-share tendency lets you predict bonding behavior without memorizing every compound. Suppose you're asked to classify the bonding in $SiCl_4$ (silicon tetrachloride) versus $NaCl$ (sodium chloride). Silicon and chlorine are both nonmetals (silicon is a metalloid but behaves nonmetallically here), so you'd predict covalent bonding — correct, as $SiCl_4$ is a molecular compound with a low melting point. Sodium, however, is a metal, so $NaCl$ should be ionic, consistent with its high melting point and electrical conductivity when molten or dissolved.

This reasoning extends to a practical skill: given an unfamiliar formula, first classify each element as metal or nonmetal, then predict whether the bonding is ionic (metal + nonmetal) or covalent (nonmetal + nonmetal). This single distinction — whether electrons transfer or share — underlies why table salt dissolves in water and conducts electricity, while sugar dissolves but does not, and why nonmetal-rich compounds like plastics are electrical insulators.

## Oxidation State

Oxidation state (also called oxidation number) is a bookkeeping value assigned to an atom in a compound that represents the charge it would have if all bonds were treated as completely ionic. It is not necessarily a real, measurable charge — it is a formal accounting tool that tracks how electrons are distributed among atoms, which makes it indispensable for identifying and balancing oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions.

To assign oxidation states, chemists follow a hierarchy of rules: free elements are 0; monatomic ions equal their charge; oxygen is usually $-2$ (except in peroxides, where it is $-1$); hydrogen is usually $+1$ (except with metals, where it is $-1$); fluorine is always $-1$; and the sum of oxidation states in a neutral compound must equal 0, or must equal the overall charge in a polyatomic ion.

**Worked example.** Find the oxidation state of manganese in permanganate, $\text{MnO}_4^-$. Oxygen contributes $4 \times (-2) = -8$. Since the ion's total charge is $-1$, manganese must satisfy:
$$
x + (-8) = -1 \implies x = +7
$$
So manganese is in the $+7$ oxidation state — its most oxidized common form.

**Problem-solving application.** Oxidation states let you spot redox reactions even when they're disguised in complex-looking equations, by tracking which atoms gain electrons (reduction, oxidation state decreases) and which lose them (oxidation, oxidation state increases). Consider the reaction:
$$
\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 3\text{CO} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + 3\text{CO}_2
$$
Assign oxidation states: iron goes from $+3$ (in $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$) to $0$ (elemental iron), so it is reduced. Carbon goes from $+2$ (in CO) to $+4$ (in $\text{CO}_2$), so it is oxidized. This confirms the reaction is a redox process even though no ions or obvious "electron transfer" are visible in the formulas. This same technique — comparing an atom's oxidation state on each side of an equation — is exactly how chemists balance complex redox reactions using the half-reaction method, and how they predict whether a proposed reaction is even chemically plausible before running it in the lab.

## Electrolysis

Electrolysis is the process of using electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction — typically decomposing a compound into its elements or simpler substances. A direct current source is connected to two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) immersed in a molten or dissolved electrolyte. At the cathode, reduction occurs as electrons are supplied to positive ions (cations); at the anode, oxidation occurs as electrons are pulled away from negative ions (anions) or from the electrode material itself. Unlike a galvanic cell, which generates electricity spontaneously from a favorable reaction, electrolysis forces an unfavorable reaction to proceed by supplying external energy.

**Worked example.** Consider the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride (NaCl), a classic industrial process for producing sodium metal and chlorine gas. At the cathode, sodium ions gain electrons: $\text{Na}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \text{Na}(l)$. At the anode, chloride ions lose electrons: $2\text{Cl}^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2(g) + 2e^-$. Combining these half-reactions (balancing electrons) gives the overall reaction: $2\text{NaCl}(l) \rightarrow 2\text{Na}(l) + \text{Cl}_2(g)$.

The one new tool we need to quantify electrolysis is **Faraday's law**: the amount of product formed is proportional to the total electric charge passed through the cell. Charge is current multiplied by time ($Q = It$, in coulombs), and every 96,485 coulombs of charge corresponds to one mole of electrons — a quantity called Faraday's constant, $F$. So moles of electrons $= Q/F$.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a current of 5.0 A is passed through molten NaCl for 2 hours. Charge passed: $Q = It = (5.0\ \text{A})(7200\ \text{s}) = 36{,}000\ \text{C}$. Moles of electrons: $36{,}000 / 96{,}485 \approx 0.373\ \text{mol } e^-$.

Now apply the stoichiometry from the half-reactions above. One electron produces one atom of Na, so we get about 0.373 mol Na — roughly 8.6 g. Two electrons are needed per molecule of $\text{Cl}_2$, so we get half as many moles of gas: about 0.187 mol, or roughly 4.18 L at standard conditions.

This pattern — current and time give charge, charge and Faraday's constant give moles of electrons, and the balanced half-reactions convert that into moles of product — is the essential skill for solving any electrolysis problem, whether refining aluminum, electroplating metal, or producing hydrogen fuel by splitting water.

## Halogens

The halogens occupy Group 17 of the periodic table: fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At), a radioactive rarity. Each has seven valence electrons, one short of a stable octet, which makes halogens the most reactive nonmetals. They readily gain one electron to form a $-1$ anion (a halide) or share one electron in a covalent bond, so they almost never exist as free atoms in nature — instead they occur as diatomic molecules ($\text{F}_2$, $\text{Cl}_2$, $\text{Br}_2$, $\text{I}_2$) or bound up in salts like $\text{NaCl}$.

Reactivity decreases down the group: fluorine is the most aggressive oxidizer of all elements, while iodine reacts more sluggishly. This trend traces to atomic size — as atoms get larger, the nucleus holds the incoming electron less tightly, so the drive to gain an electron weakens. This same trend explains **displacement reactions**: a more reactive halogen will displace a less reactive one from its salt. For example,
$$
\text{Cl}_2 + 2\text{NaBr} \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl} + \text{Br}_2
$$
Chlorine, being more reactive, steals bromine's place in the sodium salt, freeing elemental bromine (visible as the solution turns orange-brown).

**Worked example.** Suppose you're given three unlabeled solutions: sodium chloride, sodium bromide, and sodium iodide. You add a few drops of chlorine water to each. Predict what happens.

Since $\text{Cl}_2$ is more reactive than both $\text{Br}_2$ and $\text{I}_2$, it will displace bromide and iodide but not chloride (chlorine cannot displace itself). The NaCl solution shows no change. The NaBr solution turns orange as $\text{Br}_2$ forms. The NaI solution turns dark brown/black as $\text{I}_2$ forms. This is exactly the diagnostic test chemists use to identify halide ions in solution.

**Problem-solving application.** This reactivity trend isn't just a memorization exercise — it lets you predict outcomes of unfamiliar reactions. Given any two halogens and a halide salt, ask: which halogen sits higher in Group 17? That one will displace the other. This single rule — reactivity decreases down the group — lets you forecast dozens of reactions without memorizing each one individually, a hallmark of periodic-table reasoning: predicting chemistry from position rather than rote recall.

## Chlor Alkali Process

The chlor-alkali process is an industrial method that uses electrolysis to convert a brine solution (concentrated aqueous sodium chloride, $\text{NaCl}$) into three commercially vital products: chlorine gas ($\text{Cl}_2$), hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$), and sodium hydroxide ($\text{NaOH}$, also called caustic soda). It is one of the largest electrochemical processes in the world, underpinning industries ranging from PVC plastics and water treatment to soap, paper, and textile manufacturing.

The process runs in an electrolytic cell divided into two compartments by a membrane, with brine fed into the anode side. At the anode, chloride ions are oxidized: $2\text{Cl}^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2 + 2e^-$. At the cathode, water is reduced: $2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2 + 2\text{OH}^-$. Sodium ions migrate across the membrane to the cathode side, where they combine with the hydroxide ions produced there to form $\text{NaOH}$ solution. The overall reaction is:

$$2\text{NaCl} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{electrolysis}} \text{Cl}_2 + \text{H}_2 + 2\text{NaOH}$$

The membrane is essential: it allows $\text{Na}^+$ ions through but blocks $\text{Cl}^-$ and $\text{OH}^-$, preventing the chlorine and hydroxide products from mixing and reacting with each other (which would otherwise form bleach, an unwanted side reaction).

Consider a plant that needs to produce 1,000 kg of $\text{NaOH}$ per day. Using the stoichiometry above, 2 mol of $\text{NaOH}$ requires 2 mol of $\text{NaCl}$ and produces 1 mol each of $\text{Cl}_2$ and $\text{H}_2$. Since $\text{NaOH}$ has a molar mass of 40 g/mol, 1,000 kg corresponds to 25,000 mol. This yields 12,500 mol of $\text{Cl}_2$ (about 887 kg) and 12,500 mol of $\text{H}_2$ (about 25 kg) as coproducts, and consumes roughly 1,461 kg of $\text{NaCl}$ feedstock. This kind of mass-balance calculation is the everyday problem-solving task engineers perform to size reactors, plan feedstock purchases, and estimate coproduct revenue or disposal costs — since the chlorine and hydrogen streams must themselves be captured, purified, and sold or safely handled, not merely produced as byproducts of making caustic soda.

## Payoff

The chlor-alkali process is the industrial electrolysis of saturated aqueous sodium chloride (brine), producing three commercially indispensable outputs simultaneously: chlorine gas ($\text{Cl}_2$) at the anode, hydrogen gas ($\text{H}_2$) at the cathode, and sodium hydroxide ($\text{NaOH}$) accumulating in solution. The overall reaction,
$$2\,\text{NaCl}(aq) + 2\,\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \xrightarrow{\text{electrolysis}} \text{Cl}_2(g) + \text{H}_2(g) + 2\,\text{NaOH}(aq),$$
is the natural capstone of this book because it is where every prior concept converges into a single working system rather than an isolated fact. Reading it correctly requires oxidation-reduction bookkeeping (chloride is oxidized at the anode while water is reduced at the cathode), electrochemical cell design (anode/cathode separation is essential — allowing $\text{Cl}_2$ and $\text{NaOH}$ to mix produces unwanted bleach and hypochlorite side reactions), stoichiometry and Faraday's laws to size production against current and time, thermodynamics to explain why an external voltage must be supplied against an unfavorable cell potential, and industrial-scale process control (membrane cells, energy cost, mass balance) to explain why this reaction is run at planetary scale rather than in a beaker.

That convergence is exactly what makes it useful as a launching point rather than a terminus. The chlorine stream feeds directly into water treatment and disinfection chemistry, and into the synthesis of PVC and other organochlorine polymers. The sodium hydroxide stream is the workhorse base for pulp and paper processing, soap and detergent manufacture, and pH control in countless downstream syntheses. The hydrogen stream, often treated as a byproduct, is increasingly captured as clean-burning fuel or as feedstock for ammonia production via the Haber-Bosch process. Because the process yields three valuable products from one reaction, it also becomes a natural case study in industrial optimization: how do you balance electricity cost, product demand, and byproduct disposal in a single continuous operation?

From here, pick one downstream path and follow it rigorously: trace how chlorine becomes drinking-water disinfectant, how sodium hydroxide becomes soap, or how the hydrogen byproduct could displace fossil hydrogen in ammonia synthesis. Each thread turns this single reaction into an entire industry.

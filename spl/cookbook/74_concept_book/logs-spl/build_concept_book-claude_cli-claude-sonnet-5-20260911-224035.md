## Atomic Orbitals

An atomic orbital is a mathematical function that describes the probability of finding an electron at a given point around an atomic nucleus. Orbitals arise as solutions to the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom, and each solution is labeled by three quantum numbers: the principal quantum number $n$ (energy level and size, $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$), the angular momentum quantum number $l$ (shape, $l = 0, \dots, n-1$), and the magnetic quantum number $m_l$ (orientation, $m_l = -l, \dots, +l$). The value of $l$ determines the orbital "type": $l=0$ is an $s$ orbital (spherical), $l=1$ is a $p$ orbital (dumbbell-shaped), $l=2$ is a $d$ orbital, and so on. Crucially, an orbital is not a physical orbit — it is a probability density, $|\psi|^2$, describing where an electron is *likely* to be found, not a fixed trajectory.

**Worked example.** Consider a carbon atom, $Z=6$, with ground-state electron configuration $1s^2\,2s^2\,2p^2$. Electrons fill orbitals following three well-established rules of thumb: lowest-energy orbitals fill first, each orbital holds at most two electrons with opposite spin, and when several orbitals of equal energy are available (here, the three $2p$ orbitals), electrons spread out one per orbital before any pairing occurs. So the two $2p$ electrons go into two different $2p$ orbitals (e.g., $2p_x^1\,2p_y^1$) with parallel spins, rather than both pairing into $2p_x$. This configuration explains carbon's tendency to form four bonds via orbital hybridization ($sp^3$), since one $2s$ electron can be promoted to complete a half-filled set of four singly occupied orbitals.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're asked to predict the ground-state configuration of phosphorus ($Z=15$) and determine how many unpaired electrons it has. Fill orbitals in order of increasing energy: $1s^2\,2s^2\,2p^6\,3s^2\,3p^3$. The $3p$ subshell has three orbitals ($3p_x, 3p_y, 3p_z$) and three electrons; applying the same filling logic, each orbital gets one electron before any pairing, giving three unpaired electrons. This directly predicts phosphorus's paramagnetism and informs its bonding behavior (it commonly forms three covalent bonds, consistent with three singly occupied $p$ orbitals available for pairing with other atoms' electrons). This orbital-filling procedure is the standard toolkit for predicting configurations, magnetic behavior, and valence across the periodic table.

## Wave Function

A wave function, denoted $\psi(x, t)$, is the mathematical object that encodes everything quantum mechanics allows us to know about a particle's state. Unlike a classical object, which has a definite position and momentum at every instant, a quantum particle is described by $\psi$, and the particle's position is genuinely indeterminate until measured. The connection between $\psi$ and physical prediction is the Born rule: the probability of finding the particle in a small interval $dx$ around position $x$ is $|\psi(x,t)|^2 \, dx$. Because $|\psi|^2$ is a probability density, $\psi$ must satisfy the normalization condition

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x,t)|^2 \, dx = 1,$$

reflecting the certainty that the particle exists somewhere. This is not an optional formality — it is required for the probabilistic interpretation to make sense, and it is why $\psi$ is intrinsically mathematical: there is no plain-language substitute for "squared amplitude integrates to one."

**Worked example.** Consider a particle confined to a box of length $L$, in its ground state, with wave function $\psi(x) = \sqrt{2/L} \, \sin(\pi x / L)$ for $0 \le x \le L$. Check normalization:

$$\int_0^L \frac{2}{L}\sin^2\!\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right) dx = \frac{2}{L} \cdot \frac{L}{2} = 1.$$

The prefactor $\sqrt{2/L}$ was chosen precisely to make this integral equal 1 — a normalization constant, not an arbitrary choice.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you want the probability of finding this particle in the left quarter of the box, $0 \le x \le L/4$. You compute

$$P = \int_0^{L/4} \frac{2}{L}\sin^2\!\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right) dx.$$

Using $\sin^2\theta = \tfrac{1}{2}(1 - \cos 2\theta)$, this evaluates to $P = \tfrac{1}{4} - \tfrac{1}{2\pi} \approx 0.09$ — less than the classical (uniform-probability) expectation of $0.25$, because the ground-state wave function is suppressed near the walls. This illustrates the general method: given any normalized $\psi$, probabilities over a region are obtained by integrating $|\psi|^2$ over that region, turning an abstract state description into a concrete, checkable numerical prediction.

## Lcao

The Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) method is the standard approach for constructing molecular orbitals from the atomic orbitals of the atoms that make up a molecule. The core idea is that when two atoms bond, their electrons no longer belong exclusively to one nucleus; instead, the electron wavefunctions mix, and a molecular orbital $\psi$ can be approximated as a weighted sum of atomic orbitals $\phi_i$:

$$
\psi = \sum_i c_i \phi_i
$$

Here each $c_i$ is a coefficient reflecting how much a given atomic orbital contributes to the resulting molecular orbital. Because atomic orbitals are wave-like, combining them can occur in phase (constructive interference) or out of phase (destructive interference), producing two qualitatively different outcomes from the same pair of atomic orbitals.

**Worked example.** Consider the simplest possible molecule, $H_2^+$, with two hydrogen 1s orbitals, $\phi_A$ and $\phi_B$, one centered on each nucleus. LCAO predicts two molecular orbitals:

$$
\psi_{\text{bonding}} = \phi_A + \phi_B, \qquad \psi_{\text{antibonding}} = \phi_A - \phi_B
$$

The bonding orbital has electron density built up between the two nuclei, which lowers the system's potential energy and holds the atoms together. The antibonding orbital has a node (zero electron density) between the nuclei, raising the energy and pushing the atoms apart if occupied. This immediately explains why $H_2$ (two electrons, both filling the bonding orbital) is stable, while a hypothetical $He_2$ (four electrons, filling both bonding and antibonding orbitals) is not — the stabilizing and destabilizing contributions cancel.

**Problem-solving application.** LCAO becomes a genuinely useful tool once you use it to predict bond order and stability without needing to solve the full Schrödinger equation. Bond order is computed as:

$$
\text{Bond order} = \frac{(\text{bonding electrons}) - (\text{antibonding electrons})}{2}
$$

Applying this to diatomic ions like $He_2^+$ (three electrons: two bonding, one antibonding) gives a bond order of $0.5$ — nonzero, so LCAO correctly predicts this ion is weakly stable, even though neutral $He_2$ is not. This predictive power — turning a qualitative mixing picture into a quantitative stability estimate — is why LCAO remains the conceptual backbone of introductory quantum chemistry and computational methods like Hartree-Fock.

## Molecular Orbital

When atoms bond, their individual atomic orbitals no longer describe where electrons live. Instead, atomic orbitals combine into a **molecular orbital (MO)** — a wavefunction that extends over the entire molecule and describes electron behavior across two or more nuclei simultaneously. This is a genuinely quantum-mechanical idea: because orbitals are wave-like, combining two atomic orbitals means adding or subtracting their wave amplitudes, just like superposing two waves in physics. Adding the waves in phase concentrates electron density between the nuclei, pulling them together — a lower-energy, bonding form of the MO. Subtracting the waves out of phase creates a node — a region of zero electron density — between the nuclei, pushing atoms apart if electrons occupy it; this is the higher-energy, antibonding form of the same MO.

**Worked example.** Consider $\text{H}_2$, formed from two hydrogen 1s orbitals, $\psi_A$ and $\psi_B$. Combining them gives two molecular orbitals: $\psi_A + \psi_B$ (bonding, lower energy) and $\psi_A - \psi_B$ (antibonding, higher energy). Each hydrogen atom contributes one electron, and both electrons settle into the lower-energy bonding orbital, leaving the antibonding orbital empty. The result is a stable H–H bond, with both electrons paired between the nuclei — consistent with the single covalent bond chemists already draw with Lewis structures.

**Problem-solving application.** The real payoff of thinking in terms of molecular orbitals is that it predicts things a Lewis structure cannot. Take $\text{He}_2$: each helium atom contributes two electrons, so all four electrons must be placed — two fill the bonding orbital, but the remaining two are forced into the antibonding orbital. The pulling-together effect of the bonding pair is exactly canceled by the pushing-apart effect of the antibonding pair, so no net bond forms — correctly predicting that $\text{He}_2$ does not exist as a stable molecule. Now consider $\text{O}_2$: filling its molecular orbitals in order of energy leaves two electrons unpaired in equal-energy antibonding orbitals. Unpaired electrons make a substance magnetic, so this picture correctly predicts that $\text{O}_2$ is attracted to a magnetic field — famously demonstrated by liquid oxygen clinging to a magnet — a property Lewis's simple double-bond picture completely misses. By tracking how electrons fill bonding and antibonding orbitals, you can predict not just whether a bond exists, but its strength and even the molecule's magnetic behavior.

## Antibonding Molecular Orbital

When two atomic orbitals combine, they don't just add together to form one bonding orbital — quantum mechanics requires that the number of orbitals is conserved. Combining two atomic orbitals produces two molecular orbitals: one bonding, one antibonding. The bonding orbital results from constructive overlap of the atomic wavefunctions, concentrating electron density between the nuclei and lowering the system's energy. The antibonding orbital results from destructive overlap: the wavefunctions subtract rather than add, creating a node — a region of zero electron density — directly between the nuclei. Because electrons in this orbital are pushed away from the internuclear region, they leave the nuclei more exposed to each other's repulsion, raising the system's energy above that of the separated atoms. Antibonding orbitals are typically marked with an asterisk, such as $\sigma^*$ or $\pi^*$, to distinguish them from their bonding counterparts.

Consider the hydrogen molecule, $H_2$. Each hydrogen atom contributes one electron in a 1s orbital. When the two 1s orbitals combine, they form a bonding $\sigma_{1s}$ orbital (lower energy) and an antibonding $\sigma_{1s}^*$ orbital (higher energy). Both electrons occupy the lower-energy bonding orbital, so $H_2$ is stable — the antibonding orbital stays empty. Now compare this to the hypothetical $He_2$ molecule. Helium has two electrons per atom, so four electrons total must be placed. Two fill the bonding $\sigma_{1s}$ orbital, but the remaining two must occupy the antibonding $\sigma_{1s}^*$ orbital. The energy gained from the bonding pair is canceled by the energy lost from the antibonding pair, so $He_2$ is not stable — this is exactly why helium exists as isolated atoms rather than diatomic molecules.

This logic gives you a direct problem-solving tool: bond order. Bond order is calculated as
$$\text{Bond order} = \frac{(\text{electrons in bonding orbitals}) - (\text{electrons in antibonding orbitals})}{2}$$
For $H_2$: $(2-0)/2 = 1$, a single bond. For $He_2$: $(2-2)/2 = 0$, no bond at all. Try this yourself with the $He_2^+$ ion, which has only three electrons total (two bonding, one antibonding): the bond order works out to $0.5$, predicting a weak but real bond — a result confirmed experimentally. Whenever you're asked whether a diatomic species can exist, filling the molecular orbital diagram and computing bond order this way is the standard method.

## Bonding Molecular Orbital

**Definition.** When two atomic orbitals overlap constructively, their wavefunctions combine in phase, reinforcing electron density in the region between the two nuclei. The resulting molecular orbital, called a bonding molecular orbital, has lower potential energy than either contributing atomic orbital. Placing electrons in it stabilizes the molecule, because the electron density concentrated between the nuclei shields their mutual repulsion and simultaneously attracts both positively charged nuclei toward it, pulling the atoms together. This is the quantum-mechanical explanation for why covalent bonds form at all: it isn't simply "atoms want full shells," but rather that shared electron density between nuclei lowers the total energy of the system relative to separated atoms. This buildup of density between the nuclei is a purely quantum effect — it comes from the two atomic wavefunctions reinforcing each other in the overlap region — and has no classical analogue.

To compare the stability of different molecules built this way, chemists use one new quantity: **bond order**, defined as (electrons in bonding orbitals − electrons in antibonding orbitals)/2. A higher bond order means a stronger, shorter bond; a bond order of zero means no stable bond forms at all.

**Worked example.** Consider $\text{H}_2$ forming from two hydrogen atoms, each contributing a $1s$ orbital. In-phase combination produces the $\sigma_{1s}$ bonding orbital, lower in energy than either isolated $1s$ orbital, and both electrons (one from each atom) occupy it with opposite spins. The bond order is $(2-0)/2 = 1$, consistent with the single H–H bond and its measured energy of about 436 kJ/mol.

**Problem-solving application.** Bond order predicts stability and reactivity directly. For $\text{He}_2$, each He atom supplies two $1s$ electrons; two must occupy the bonding orbital and two the antibonding orbital, giving a bond order of $(2-2)/2 = 0$ — correctly predicting that $\text{He}_2$ does not exist as a stable molecule. Similarly, for $\text{O}_2$, filling molecular orbitals in order predicts two unpaired electrons in antibonding orbitals, explaining O₂'s observed paramagnetism, a fact simple Lewis structures fail to capture. Use bond order calculations like these to compare bond strength and predict existence and stability across a series of related diatomic species.

## Electron Configuration

**Definition.** An electron configuration is a shorthand notation describing how electrons are distributed among an atom's orbitals. Electrons fill orbitals according to three governing rules: the **Aufbau principle** (electrons occupy the lowest-energy orbitals available first), the **Pauli exclusion principle** (each orbital holds at most two electrons, with opposite spins), and **Hund's rule** (electrons fill degenerate orbitals — orbitals of equal energy, like the three $p$ orbitals — singly before pairing up). Orbitals are labeled by principal quantum number $n$ and subshell type ($s$, $p$, $d$, $f$), with maximum electron capacities of 2, 6, 10, and 14 respectively. The filling order follows increasing $(n + \ell)$, summarized by the diagonal rule: $1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, \dots$

**Worked example.** Consider iron, $Z = 26$. Filling orbitals in order and tracking the electron count: $1s^2$ (2), $2s^2$ (4), $2p^6$ (10), $3s^2$ (12), $3p^6$ (18), $4s^2$ (20), $3d^6$ (26). The full configuration is:
$$1s^2\,2s^2\,2p^6\,3s^2\,3p^6\,4s^2\,3d^6$$
Note that $4s$ fills before $3d$ despite $3d$ belonging to a lower principal shell — this is because $4s$ has lower energy in neutral atoms at this point in the periodic table. A common shorthand uses the previous noble gas as a core: $[\text{Ar}]\,4s^2 3d^6$.

**Problem-solving application.** Electron configurations let you predict chemical behavior directly from an atom's position on the periodic table, without memorizing individual elements. Two skills matter most in practice:

1. *Predicting reactivity and ion charge.* Atoms tend toward configurations that fill or empty their outermost (valence) subshell. Chlorine ($[\text{Ne}]3s^2 3p^5$) is one electron short of a filled $3p^6$ shell, so it readily gains an electron to form $\text{Cl}^-$. Magnesium ($[\text{Ne}]3s^2$) loses its two valence electrons to form $\text{Mg}^{2+}$, achieving the neon configuration.

2. *Handling exceptions.* Some transition metals deviate from the diagonal rule because half-filled or fully-filled $d$ subshells are unusually stable. Chromium is $[\text{Ar}]4s^1 3d^5$ rather than the "expected" $4s^2 3d^4$, since a half-filled $3d^5$ lowers overall energy through reduced electron-electron repulsion.

When solving configuration problems, always cross-check your electron count against $Z$, and for ions, remove or add electrons from the *outermost* shell first — even when that means removing $4s$ electrons before $3d$ electrons, since $3d$ becomes lower in energy than $4s$ once occupied.

## Molecular Orbital Theory

When atoms bond, their atomic orbitals do not simply overlap and stay put — they combine mathematically to form new orbitals that belong to the molecule as a whole. Molecular orbital (MO) theory treats bonding as a quantum mechanical mixing process: atomic orbitals of similar energy and symmetry combine, via linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO), to produce molecular orbitals that can extend over two or more nuclei. Each combination of $n$ atomic orbitals produces $n$ molecular orbitals — some bonding (lower energy, electron density concentrated between nuclei) and some antibonding (higher energy, with a node between nuclei, marked with an asterisk, e.g., $\sigma^*$). Electrons fill these molecular orbitals following the same rules as atomic orbitals: lowest energy first, Pauli exclusion, Hund's rule for degenerate orbitals.

**Worked example**: Consider $\text{H}_2$. Each hydrogen atom contributes one 1s orbital. Combining them in phase gives a bonding orbital, $\sigma_{1s}$, lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals; combining them out of phase gives an antibonding orbital, $\sigma_{1s}^*$, higher in energy. With two electrons total, both occupy $\sigma_{1s}$, leaving $\sigma_{1s}^*$ empty. Bond order, defined as
$$\text{Bond order} = \frac{1}{2}(\text{bonding electrons} - \text{antibonding electrons}),$$
equals $\frac{1}{2}(2-0) = 1$, consistent with the single bond we already know exists in $\text{H}_2$.

**Problem-solving application**: MO theory earns its keep by explaining cases where simpler bonding pictures fail. Take $\text{He}_2$: each helium atom brings two electrons, four total, filling both $\sigma_{1s}$ and $\sigma_{1s}^*$. Bond order $= \frac{1}{2}(2-2) = 0$, correctly predicting that $\text{He}_2$ does not exist as a stable molecule — a result Lewis structures alone cannot produce, since they offer no mechanism for "canceling" a bond. MO theory also predicts magnetic behavior: for $\text{O}_2$, filling molecular orbitals in order of energy leaves two electrons unpaired in degenerate antibonding $\pi^*$ orbitals (by Hund's rule), correctly predicting that $\text{O}_2$ is paramagnetic — a fact that classical Lewis dot structures, which pair all valence electrons, fail to explain. When asked to compare bond strength or stability across related species (e.g., $\text{O}_2$ versus $\text{O}_2^+$ versus $\text{O}_2^-$), compute bond order for each: removing an antibonding electron increases bond order and strengthens the bond, while adding one weakens it.

---

## Bond Order

Bond order is a number that tells you how many chemical bonds are shared between two atoms — essentially, how much "glue" holds them together. A bond order of 1 corresponds to a single bond (one shared pair of electrons), 2 to a double bond, and 3 to a triple bond. The concept matters because bond order correlates directly with two measurable properties: bond length and bond energy. Higher bond order means a shorter, stronger bond, because more electron density is packed between the two nuclei, pulling them closer together and requiring more energy to pull apart.

For simple molecules built from Lewis structures, bond order is just the number of shared electron pairs between two specific atoms. Consider the nitrogen molecule, $N_2$. Its Lewis structure shows a triple bond: $:N \equiv N:$. Between the two nitrogen atoms there are three shared pairs, so the bond order is 3. Compare this to oxygen, $O_2$, with a double bond ($O=O$), bond order 2, and to fluorine, $F_2$, with a single bond ($F-F$), bond order 1. Measured bond lengths confirm the pattern: $N_2$ is about 110 pm, $O_2$ about 121 pm, and $F_2$ about 142 pm — bond order and bond length move in opposite directions.

Bond order becomes especially useful — and slightly more involved — when electrons are delocalized across more than two atoms, as in molecular orbital (MO) theory or resonance structures. In MO theory, bond order is calculated as:

$$
\text{Bond order} = \frac{(\text{number of bonding electrons}) - (\text{number of antibonding electrons})}{2}
$$

Apply this to the diatomic ion $O_2^{+}$. Removing one electron from $O_2$ removes it from an antibonding orbital, giving 10 bonding and 5 antibonding electrons: bond order $= (10-5)/2 = 2.5$. This fractional value is a real, testable prediction — it means the O–O bond in $O_2^{+}$ should be shorter and stronger than in neutral $O_2$ (bond order 2), which is exactly what experiments show.

This formula is a genuine problem-solving tool: given an electron configuration, you can predict relative bond strength, bond length, and even magnetic behavior (unpaired electrons in antibonding orbitals make a species paramagnetic) without needing to draw every orbital diagram from scratch.

## Diamagnetism

Every material responds to a magnetic field, but most responses are too weak to notice without instruments. Diamagnetism is the universal tendency of matter to weakly repel an applied magnetic field, generating an induced magnetization that opposes the field rather than reinforcing it. It arises in all materials because it stems from electromagnetic induction acting on orbiting electrons, but it is only *observable* in substances that lack unpaired electrons — otherwise the much stronger paramagnetic or ferromagnetic response (from electron spins aligning with the field) overwhelms it.

The mechanism follows directly from Faraday's law and Lenz's law. When an external magnetic field is switched on, the changing flux through an electron's orbital path induces a small additional circulating current. By Lenz's law, that induced current opposes the change that caused it — so the resulting magnetic moment points opposite to the applied field. This is why diamagnetic materials are characterized by a small, negative magnetic susceptibility, $\chi < 0$, typically on the order of $10^{-5}$, meaning the induced magnetization $M = \chi H$ is tiny and opposes $H$.

A concrete illustration: superconductors are perfect diamagnets ($\chi = -1$), which is why a magnet levitates above a superconducting disk — the Meissner effect. On a much smaller scale, water, wood, and most biological tissue are weakly diamagnetic, which is why frogs and even strawberries have been levitated in sufficiently strong laboratory magnets (tens of teslas): the induced repulsive force balances gravity.

For problem-solving, the practical skill is estimating whether diamagnetism will be detectable in a given material and predicting the direction of the induced force. Given a material's electron configuration, check for unpaired electrons: if all orbitals are filled (as in noble gases, many ionic solids like NaCl, or covalently bonded organics), the material is purely diamagnetic. If unpaired electrons exist, paramagnetic effects dominate and diamagnetism becomes a negligible correction. Because $\chi < 0$ always, you can also predict that a diamagnetic sample placed in a nonuniform field will be pushed toward the region of *weaker* field — the opposite behavior of paramagnetic or ferromagnetic materials, which are pulled toward stronger field regions.

---

## Paramagnetism

Paramagnetism is a form of weak, temporary magnetism exhibited by materials whose atoms or ions possess unpaired electrons. Each unpaired electron acts as a tiny magnetic dipole because of its spin and orbital motion. In the absence of an external magnetic field, these atomic dipoles point in random directions, so their effects cancel and the material shows no net magnetization. When an external field is applied, the dipoles partially align with the field, producing a net magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. This is what distinguishes paramagnetic materials from diamagnetic ones (which are weakly repelled by a field) and from ferromagnetic ones (which retain magnetization after the field is removed). Common paramagnetic substances include oxygen gas, aluminum, and many transition-metal and lanthanide compounds, wherever the electron configuration leaves one or more electrons unpaired.

The degree of alignment—and hence the strength of the induced magnetization—depends on the competition between the aligning influence of the field and the randomizing effect of thermal motion. This relationship is captured by the Curie law:
$$
M = \frac{C B}{T}
$$
where $M$ is the magnetization, $B$ is the applied magnetic field, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $C$ is a material-specific constant called the Curie constant. The law shows that magnetization increases with field strength but decreases as temperature rises, since higher thermal energy disrupts the alignment of dipoles. Because the relationship is intrinsically a temperature-dependent statistical result (arising from the balance between magnetic and thermal energy at the atomic scale), the law is best understood in this equation form rather than through prose alone.

**Worked example.** Suppose a paramagnetic sample has a Curie constant $C = 2.5 \times 10^{-4}\ \text{K}$ and is placed in a field $B = 0.8\ \text{T}$ at room temperature ($T = 300\ \text{K}$). Using the Curie law:
$$
M = \frac{(2.5 \times 10^{-4})(0.8)}{300} = 6.7 \times 10^{-7}
$$
This small value reflects the generally weak nature of paramagnetic response.

**Problem-solving application.** Curie's law lets scientists diagnose material behavior: if measured magnetization scales linearly with $1/T$, the material is confirmed paramagnetic, and $C$ can be extracted from the slope. This technique is used in materials science to identify unpaired electron content in new compounds, and in geology to study magnetic minerals, since anomalies from the predicted linear trend often signal a transition to ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ordering at lower temperatures.

## Sp Mixing

**Definition.** In molecular orbital (MO) theory, s-p mixing describes what happens when atomic orbitals of similar energy — specifically the $2s$ orbital of one atom and the $2p_z$ orbital of another — interact and blend rather than combining independently. In the simplest MO picture, $2s$ orbitals combine only with other $2s$ orbitals, and $2p$ orbitals combine only with other $2p$ orbitals, producing a fixed energy ordering of molecular orbitals. But when the energy gap between the $2s$ and $2p$ atomic orbitals is small enough, the $\sigma_{2s}$ and $\sigma_{2p_z}$ molecular orbitals mix with each other, pushing the $\sigma_{2s}$ lower in energy and the $\sigma_{2p_z}$ higher. This raises the $\sigma_{2p_z}$ orbital above the $\pi_{2p}$ orbitals in energy — a reordering that matters for predicting molecular properties.

**Worked example.** Consider the homonuclear diatomics of period 2. For $\mathrm{O_2}$, $\mathrm{F_2}$, and $\mathrm{Ne_2}$, the $2s$–$2p$ energy gap is large, so mixing is negligible and the standard order holds: $\sigma_{2p_z} < \pi_{2p_x} = \pi_{2p_y}$. But for $\mathrm{B_2}$, $\mathrm{C_2}$, and $\mathrm{N_2}$, the $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals are closer in energy, mixing is significant, and the order flips: $\pi_{2p_x} = \pi_{2p_y} < \sigma_{2p_z}$. This flip is not a minor bookkeeping detail — it changes predicted magnetic behavior. Filling electrons into $\mathrm{N_2}$'s MO diagram with the mixed ordering correctly predicts that $\mathrm{N_2}$ is diamagnetic, matching experiment. Using the unmixed ordering for $\mathrm{B_2}$ would incorrectly predict it as diamagnetic; only the mixed-order diagram gives $\mathrm{B_2}$ two unpaired electrons in degenerate $\pi$ orbitals, correctly predicting its observed paramagnetism.

**Problem-solving application.** When asked to predict the bond order or magnetism of a period-2 diatomic, first check which regime applies: for $\mathrm{Li_2}$ through $\mathrm{N_2}$ (and their ions with similar electron counts), use the mixed ordering; for $\mathrm{O_2}$ through $\mathrm{Ne_2}$, use the standard ordering. As a diagnostic shortcut, if the observed magnetic behavior of a molecule contradicts the prediction from the standard MO order, that mismatch is itself evidence that s-p mixing is operating — the experimental data tells you which energy-level diagram to trust.

## Homonuclear Diatomic Mo Configurations

**Definition**

When two identical atoms bond, their atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals (MOs) that extend over both nuclei. For homonuclear diatomics (like $\text{H}_2$, $\text{N}_2$, $\text{O}_2$), each pair of atomic orbitals combines in two ways: constructively, lowering energy (bonding orbital), and destructively, raising energy (antibonding orbital, marked with an asterisk). For second-row elements, the relevant $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals produce the sequence:

$$\sigma_{2s} < \sigma_{2s}^* < \sigma_{2p} < \pi_{2p} \ (\text{doubly degenerate}) < \pi_{2p}^* \ (\text{doubly degenerate}) < \sigma_{2p}^*$$

(Note: for $\text{B}_2$, $\text{C}_2$, and $\text{N}_2$, the $\pi_{2p}$ orbitals sit *below* $\sigma_{2p}$ due to $s$-$p$ mixing — an experimentally confirmed reordering, not an exception to memorize blindly.)

Electrons fill these MOs following the same rules as atomic orbitals: Aufbau (lowest energy first), Pauli exclusion (two electrons per orbital, opposite spins), and Hund's rule (degenerate orbitals fill singly before pairing).

**Worked example**

Consider $\text{O}_2$, with 12 valence electrons (6 from each oxygen). Filling in order:

$$\sigma_{2s}^2 \, \sigma_{2s}^{*2} \, \sigma_{2p}^2 \, \pi_{2p}^4 \, \pi_{2p}^{*2}$$

The last two electrons enter the degenerate $\pi_{2p}^*$ pair singly, one in each orbital, by Hund's rule — leaving $\text{O}_2$ with two unpaired electrons. This is the classic case where MO theory succeeds where Lewis structures fail: a simple Lewis diagram shows all electrons paired, but $\text{O}_2$ is experimentally paramagnetic (attracted to magnetic fields), confirming unpaired electrons.

**Problem-solving application**

MO configurations let you predict bond order and stability directly:

$$\text{Bond order} = \frac{(\text{bonding electrons}) - (\text{antibonding electrons})}{2}$$

For $\text{O}_2$: bonding electrons = 8 ($\sigma_{2s}^2, \sigma_{2p}^2, \pi_{2p}^4$), antibonding = 4 ($\sigma_{2s}^{*2}, \pi_{2p}^{*2}$), giving bond order $= (8-4)/2 = 2$, consistent with the O=O double bond.

Try this: predict whether $\text{O}_2^+$ (remove one electron from the $\pi^*$ set) has a stronger or weaker bond than neutral $\text{O}_2$. Removing an antibonding electron raises bond order to 2.5 — so $\text{O}_2^+$ has a shorter, stronger bond, a prediction confirmed by measured bond lengths.

---

## Payoff

Every concept in this book has been building toward a single question: why do molecules bond the way they do, and how do we predict the properties that follow from that bonding? Homonuclear diatomic molecular orbital configurations answer this question in its purest form, because two identical atoms sharing electrons is the simplest possible bonding scenario — no electronegativity difference, no asymmetry, nothing to obscure the underlying physics. By combining atomic orbitals ($\sigma_{2s}$, $\sigma_{2s}^*$, $\sigma_{2p}$, $\pi_{2p}$, $\pi_{2p}^*$, $\sigma_{2p}^*$) and filling them according to the Aufbau principle and Hund's rule, we can calculate bond order, predict magnetic behavior, and explain why $\mathrm{O_2}$ is paramagnetic while $\mathrm{N_2}$ is not — a fact that simple Lewis structures cannot account for. This is the natural endpoint of the book because it is the first place where every earlier idea — atomic structure, quantum numbers, orbital shapes, energy ordering, electron configuration — must work together simultaneously to explain a real, measurable property of matter.

From here, the applications radiate outward. In **materials science**, the same orbital-filling logic explains why some diatomic species form strong multiple bonds and others do not, guiding the design of catalysts and gas-storage materials. In **spectroscopy**, MO energy gaps predict the wavelengths of light a molecule absorbs or emits, which is how astronomers identify $\mathrm{N_2}^+$ or $\mathrm{O_2}$ in interstellar clouds and planetary atmospheres from light-years away. In **atmospheric and environmental chemistry**, understanding the strength of the $\mathrm{N_2}$ triple bond (a direct consequence of its MO configuration) explains why nitrogen fixation is energetically expensive and why industrial processes like the Haber–Bosch process require extreme conditions. In **magnetochemistry**, predicting paramagnetism from unpaired electrons in $\pi^*$ orbitals underlies techniques used to characterize new compounds in the lab.

Pick one of these domains and follow it further: trace how the bond order of $\mathrm{O_2}$, derived entirely from its MO diagram, explains its unusual reactivity as a biradical — the very property that makes it essential, and occasionally dangerous, to life as we know it.

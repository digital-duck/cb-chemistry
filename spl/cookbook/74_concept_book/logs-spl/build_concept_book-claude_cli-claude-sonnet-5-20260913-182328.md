## Energy

**Definition.** Energy is a scalar quantity that measures a physical system's capacity to perform work. In classical mechanics, the total mechanical energy $E$ of a particle is the sum of kinetic energy $K$ and potential energy $U$:
$$
E = K + U = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + U(x).
$$
Here $m$ is mass, $v$ is speed, and $U(x)$ is a potential function depending on position. Energy is conserved in an isolated system subject only to conservative forces — forces derivable from a potential via $F(x) = -\dfrac{dU}{dx}$.

**Worked example.** Consider a particle of mass $m$ moving under gravity near Earth's surface, with potential energy $U(x) = mgx$, where $x$ is height and $g$ is gravitational acceleration. If the particle is dropped from rest at height $h$, its total energy at height $x$ is
$$
E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgx = mgh,
$$
since $E$ is conserved and initially $v=0$, $x=h$. Solving for speed at the ground ($x=0$) gives $v = \sqrt{2gh}$, the familiar free-fall velocity formula.

**Key theorem (Work–Energy Theorem).** The net work $W$ done on a particle equals its change in kinetic energy:
$$
W = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} F(x)\,dx = K(x_2) - K(x_1).
$$
*Proof sketch.* By Newton's second law, $F = m\dfrac{dv}{dt}$. Using the chain rule, $F = mv\dfrac{dv}{dx}$, so
$$
\int_{x_1}^{x_2} F\,dx = \int_{v_1}^{v_2} mv\,dv = \frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2,
$$
establishing the result. When $F$ is conservative, $W = -\Delta U$, recovering conservation of total mechanical energy.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
import sympy as sp

m, g, h, x, v = sp.symbols('m g h x v', positive=True)
U = m * g * x
K = sp.Rational(1,2) * m * v**2

# Solve for v when E = mgh and x = 0
v_ground = sp.solve(sp.Eq(K.subs(v, sp.symbols('v')) , m*g*h), sp.symbols('v'))
print(v_ground)  # [-sqrt(2)*sqrt(g*h), sqrt(2)*sqrt(g*h)]
```
```

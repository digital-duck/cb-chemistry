## Electrostatic Force

Electrostatic force is the push or pull between two electrically charged objects, arising from the charges themselves rather than from motion or contact. It is one of the four fundamental forces in nature (a manifestation of the electromagnetic force) and is described quantitatively by Coulomb's law:

$$F = k_e \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}$$

Here $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of the two charges (in coulombs), $r$ is the distance between their centers (in meters), and $k_e \approx 8.99 \times 10^9\ \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2$ is Coulomb's constant. Like charges repel; opposite charges attract. The force acts along the line connecting the two charges, and its strength falls off with the square of the distance — the same inverse-square pattern found in gravity, but electrostatic force can be either attractive or repulsive and is vastly stronger for particles like electrons and protons.

**Worked example.** Suppose two small charged spheres carry $q_1 = 2 \times 10^{-6}\,\text{C}$ and $q_2 = -3 \times 10^{-6}\,\text{C}$, separated by $r = 0.5\,\text{m}$. The force magnitude is

$$F = (8.99 \times 10^9) \frac{(2\times10^{-6})(3\times10^{-6})}{(0.5)^2} \approx 0.216\ \text{N}$$

Since the charges have opposite signs, the force is attractive: each sphere is pulled toward the other along the line joining them.

**Problem-solving application.** Coulomb's law becomes especially useful when multiple charges interact, because forces from different sources add as vectors (superposition). Consider three charges arranged in a line: $q_1$ and $q_2$ on either side of $q_3$. To find the net force on $q_3$, compute the force from $q_1$ on $q_3$ and the force from $q_2$ on $q_3$ separately using Coulomb's law, then add them as vectors — accounting for direction, not just magnitude. This mirrors the general strategy engineers and physicists use for any field-based problem: isolate the object of interest, compute each pairwise interaction, and sum the contributions vectorially. The same reasoning extends to more complex geometries (charges arranged in a triangle, a ring, or a grid), where breaking the problem into components along $x$- and $y$-axes before summing is essential for getting the correct net force and direction.

## Intermolecular Forces

**Definition.** Intermolecular forces are the attractions that act *between* molecules, distinct from the covalent or ionic bonds that hold atoms together *within* a molecule. Three main types matter for most chemistry problems. London dispersion forces arise in all molecules from momentary, shifting imbalances in electron distribution, and grow stronger with more electrons and larger, more polarizable surface area. Dipole-dipole forces occur between molecules with a permanent unequal sharing of electrons (a dipole), where the partially positive end of one molecule attracts the partially negative end of another. Hydrogen bonding, the strongest of the three, occurs when a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (N, O, or F) is attracted to a lone pair on a nearby electronegative atom. The strength ordering is generally hydrogen bonding > dipole-dipole > dispersion, though large enough molecules can have dispersion forces that outweigh dipole-dipole forces in smaller ones.

**Worked example.** Compare the boiling points of butane ($\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}$, bp $-1\,^\circ\text{C}$) and diethyl ether ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OC}_2\text{H}_5$, bp $35\,^\circ\text{C}$), two molecules of similar molar mass. Butane is nonpolar, so its molecules interact only through dispersion forces. Diethyl ether has a bent C–O–C arrangement with an oxygen atom that gives it a net dipole, adding dipole-dipole attraction on top of dispersion forces. Because boiling requires overcoming intermolecular attractions, the ether's additional dipole-dipole interaction demands more thermal energy, explaining its higher boiling point despite comparable size.

**Problem-solving application.** When ranking boiling or melting points, work through molecules in this order: first check for O–H or N–H bonds (hydrogen bonding present); if absent, check for a permanent dipole from unequal electronegativity and asymmetric shape (dipole-dipole present); if the molecule is symmetric and nonpolar, only dispersion forces apply, and size/surface area become the deciding factor. For example, predict which boils higher: methanol ($\text{CH}_3\text{OH}$) or ethane ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_6$), both with similar molar mass. Methanol has an O–H bond capable of hydrogen bonding; ethane has only dispersion forces. Methanol's boiling point ($65\,^\circ\text{C}$) is far higher than ethane's ($-89\,^\circ\text{C}$), confirming the rule. This stepwise check — hydrogen bonding, then dipole, then dispersion — is the reliable strategy for predicting relative physical properties from molecular structure alone.

## Cohesive Forces

Cohesive forces are the attractive forces that hold molecules of the same substance together. In liquids, these forces arise mainly from intermolecular attractions such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and van der Waals forces. They are why liquids maintain a definite volume, resist expansion, and form droplets rather than dispersing into a formless gas. The strength of cohesive forces in a substance directly determines properties like surface tension, viscosity, and boiling point.

Water is the textbook example. Each water molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules, giving water unusually strong cohesion compared to similarly sized molecules like methane, which lacks hydrogen bonding. This is why water beads up on a waxed car hood — the molecules at the surface are pulled inward and sideways by their neighbors more strongly than they are pulled outward toward the air, minimizing surface area into a rounded droplet. It's also why a water strider insect can walk on a pond: the cohesive "skin" at the surface, quantified as surface tension, supports the insect's weight without breaking.

Cohesive forces become a practical design variable whenever engineers or scientists must predict how a liquid will behave in a system. Consider capillary action, which arises from a competition between cohesive forces (liquid-liquid attraction) and adhesive forces (liquid-surface attraction). In a narrow glass tube, water climbs upward because its adhesion to glass exceeds its internal cohesion, pulling the liquid column up until gravity balances the pull. Mercury, by contrast, has strong cohesion but weak adhesion to glass, so it forms a convex meniscus and is depressed rather than raised in a capillary tube.

This distinction has direct applications: soil scientists use capillary action to predict how water moves through fine-grained soil to plant roots; textile engineers rely on it to design fabrics that wick sweat away from skin; and paper chromatography separates chemical mixtures by exploiting how differently sized molecules travel at different rates through a cohesive/adhesive liquid front. When troubleshooting why a liquid fails to wet a surface, spreads unevenly, or clumps into droplets, the first diagnostic question is always the same: how do the cohesive forces within the liquid compare to the adhesive forces at its boundary?

## Adhesive Forces

Adhesive forces are the attractive forces between molecules of *different* substances — for example, between water molecules and the glass wall of a container. They arise from the same fundamental interactions that produce cohesive forces (the attraction between *like* molecules, such as water to water): hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and dipole-dipole attractions. What distinguishes adhesion from cohesion is simply which molecules are involved. Whether a liquid wets a surface, climbs a narrow tube, or beads up and rolls off depends on the balance between these two forces.

**Worked example.** Consider a thin glass capillary tube inserted into a dish of water. Water molecules are attracted to the glass (adhesion) and to each other (cohesion). Because adhesion between water and glass is stronger than the cohesion among water molecules, the water climbs the tube walls, and surface tension pulls the rest of the liquid surface upward with it — the meniscus curves upward (concave). This is capillary rise, and it explains why paper towels absorb spills, why tree xylem can draw water upward, and why a wet paintbrush holds liquid between its bristles. Now compare mercury in the same glass tube: mercury's cohesive forces (metallic bonding between mercury atoms) are much stronger than its adhesion to glass, so the liquid pulls away from the walls, producing a convex meniscus and a slight depression rather than a rise.

**Problem-solving application.** When predicting how a liquid will behave on or in a solid, ask two questions: (1) Is adhesion stronger or weaker than cohesion? (2) What does that imply for the contact angle and surface shape? If adhesion dominates (as with water on clean glass), expect wetting, a low contact angle, and capillary rise. If cohesion dominates (as with mercury on glass, or water on a waxy leaf), expect beading, a high contact angle, and no capillary action. This reasoning generalizes beyond liquids in tubes: it explains why waterproof fabrics are engineered with low-adhesion coatings, why soldering requires a flux to increase metal-to-metal adhesion, and why adhesive tape uses polymers formulated to maximize attraction to a target surface while minimizing internal cohesive failure. In each case, the practical design problem — choose a coating, a solvent, a fabric treatment — reduces to manipulating the relative strength of adhesive versus cohesive forces at the molecular level.

## Capillary Action

Capillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow through a narrow space — a thin tube, a gap between fibers, or the pores of a porous material — without help from gravity, and sometimes directly against it. It happens because of a competition between two forces: adhesion, the attraction between liquid molecules and the surface of the tube, and cohesion, the attraction between liquid molecules and each other. When adhesion to the tube walls is stronger than cohesion within the liquid, the liquid "wets" the surface and climbs; when cohesion dominates, the liquid resists the surface and is pushed down, as mercury does in a glass tube.

The height a liquid rises in a narrow tube can be predicted quantitatively, because the phenomenon is a genuine force balance. The upward pull comes from surface tension acting around the inner circumference of the tube, while the downward pull is the weight of the risen liquid column. Setting these equal gives the Jurin's law relation:

$$h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r}$$

where $\gamma$ is the liquid's surface tension, $\theta$ is the contact angle between the liquid and the tube wall, $\rho$ is the liquid density, $g$ is gravitational acceleration, and $r$ is the tube's inner radius. The key insight is the inverse relationship with $r$: halving the radius doubles the rise height. This is why capillary action is negligible in a drinking straw but dramatic in the microscopic vessels of a plant stem or the tiny gaps of a paper towel.

**Worked example.** A glass capillary tube with radius $r = 0.10\text{ mm}$ is dipped in water at $20^\circ\text{C}$, where $\gamma = 0.0728\text{ N/m}$, $\rho = 1000\text{ kg/m}^3$, and the contact angle with clean glass is nearly $0^\circ$ ($\cos\theta \approx 1$). Then:

$$h = \frac{2(0.0728)(1)}{(1000)(9.8)(0.0001)} \approx 0.149\text{ m} \approx 15\text{ cm}$$

**Problem-solving application.** This formula lets engineers and biologists reason quantitatively about real systems: estimating the maximum height water can passively rise in xylem vessels of a given diameter, sizing wick channels in fuel gauges or diagnostic test strips (as in lateral-flow assays), or predicting whether a soil's pore size will retain moisture against gravity during drought. Given any three of $\gamma$, $\theta$, $\rho$, or $r$, students can solve for the fourth — for instance, determining the maximum pore radius soil must have to wick water to a 30 cm root depth.

## Surface Tension

Surface tension is the tendency of a liquid's surface to behave like a stretched elastic membrane, resisting deformation and minimizing its own area. It arises because molecules inside a liquid are pulled equally in all directions by neighboring molecules (cohesive forces), while molecules at the surface have neighbors only below and beside them, not above. This imbalance creates a net inward pull, which makes the surface act as though it were under tension. Surface tension is quantified as $\gamma$, the energy required to increase the surface area by a unit amount, or equivalently the force per unit length acting along the surface: $\gamma = F/L$, with SI units of $\text{N/m}$ (equivalent to $\text{J/m}^2$).

**Worked example.** A wire loop of circumference 10 cm is dipped in a soapy solution, forming a thin film across it. To pull the film apart, you must exert a force against both surfaces of the film (front and back), since a soap film has two liquid-air interfaces. If the surface tension of the solution is $\gamma = 0.025\ \text{N/m}$, the force needed to hold the film together along a straight edge of length $L = 0.10\ \text{m}$ is $F = 2\gamma L = 2(0.025)(0.10) = 0.005\ \text{N}$. This factor of 2 is a common source of error: always check whether a system has one liquid surface (like a droplet) or two (like a soap film) before applying $F = \gamma L$.

**Problem-solving application.** Surface tension explains why a steel needle, denser than water, can float if placed carefully on the surface: the needle's weight is supported by the vertical component of the surface tension force acting along the length of the depression it creates, rather than by buoyancy. It also explains capillary rise, where a liquid climbs a narrow tube because adhesive forces between the liquid and tube walls pull the surface upward, and surface tension transmits that pull to the rest of the liquid column, raising it until the weight of the raised liquid balances the tension force. In problem-solving, the key skill is identifying how many surfaces are involved and in which direction the tension acts, then applying $F = \gamma L$ (or its multiple-surface variant) to find forces, or balancing tension against gravity to find heights or maximum supportable weights — the same logic used in engineering applications like inkjet printing, insect locomotion on water, and detergent design.

## Capillary Rise Equation

When you dip a thin glass tube into water, the liquid climbs up inside the tube to a height noticeably above the surface outside — this is capillary rise, and it results from a competition between two forces: adhesion (the attraction between liquid molecules and the tube's inner wall) and the surface tension of the liquid itself. Because this is a genuine physical law derived from a force balance, it earns a compact formula rather than pure prose.

Consider a narrow tube of radius $r$ inserted vertically into a liquid of density $\rho$ and surface tension $\gamma$. The liquid's surface tension pulls the liquid up along the tube's circumference (length $2\pi r$), while gravity pulls the risen column back down. At equilibrium, the upward force from surface tension equals the weight of the raised liquid column:

$$2\pi r \gamma \cos\theta = \rho g \pi r^2 h$$

Solving for the rise height $h$ gives the capillary rise equation:

$$h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r}$$

Here $\theta$ is the contact angle between the liquid and the tube wall (near $0°$ for water in clean glass, meaning $\cos\theta \approx 1$), and $g$ is gravitational acceleration.

**Worked example.** Water ($\gamma = 0.073 \text{ N/m}$, $\rho = 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3$) rises in a glass capillary of radius $r = 0.1 \text{ mm} = 1 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}$, with $\theta \approx 0°$:

$$h = \frac{2(0.073)(1)}{(1000)(9.8)(1 \times 10^{-4})} \approx 0.149 \text{ m} \approx 14.9 \text{ cm}$$

This matches the everyday observation that narrower tubes produce dramatically higher rises.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you need to design a wicking channel in a microfluidic diagnostic device (like a home pregnancy test strip) that must draw a blood sample ($\gamma \approx 0.058 \text{ N/m}$, $\rho \approx 1060 \text{ kg/m}^3$) at least 3 cm up a channel using capillary action alone, with contact angle $\theta = 30°$. Rearranging the equation to solve for the required radius:

$$r = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g h} = \frac{2(0.058)(\cos 30°)}{(1060)(9.8)(0.03)} \approx 3.2 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m} \approx 32\ \mu\text{m}$$

This inverse relationship — smaller radius, greater rise — is exactly why lab-on-a-chip devices rely on micron-scale channels rather than millimeter-scale ones to move fluids without pumps.

## Payoff

Every concept in this book has been building toward a single question: what happens when a liquid meets a narrow tube? The capillary rise equation,

$$
h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r},
$$

answers it by tying together surface tension $\gamma$, the contact angle $\theta$ between liquid and solid, the liquid's density $\rho$, gravitational acceleration $g$, and the tube's radius $r$. It is the natural endpoint of this course because it is a genuine synthesis: it takes surface tension (a molecular-scale property) and gravity (a bulk-scale force) and shows how they balance to produce a measurable, macroscopic outcome — the height $h$ a liquid climbs against gravity in a thin tube. No earlier concept in the book stands alone in the same way; each contributes one piece to this final force balance.

The equation's applications span far beyond a glass tube in a lab. In **plant biology**, it explains how water rises through the xylem of trees, since xylem vessels behave as bundles of capillaries only micrometers wide — without this mechanism, water could not reach leaves dozens of meters above the roots. In **soil science and hydrology**, it governs how water wicks upward through soil pores after rainfall, determining how deep roots must grow to find moisture. In **materials engineering**, it explains why paper towels, sponges, and wicking fabrics absorb liquid, and it guides the design of microfluidic "lab-on-a-chip" devices, where channels are engineered at exactly the radius needed to move fluid without pumps. In **medicine**, it describes how blood samples are drawn into thin glass capillary tubes for testing, and why blotting paper in diagnostic strips pulls a controlled volume of fluid across a test line.

In every case, the same variables reappear: shrink the radius $r$, and the rise $h$ grows; change the liquid's surface tension or the wetting angle with the solid, and the behavior changes predictably. That portability — one equation explaining a redwood's water supply, a diagnostic test strip, and a microfluidic chip — is what makes it a fitting capstone.

Choose one of these applications and work through it in depth: calculate the maximum height water can climb in xylem vessels of a given radius, and compare it to the height of the tallest trees on Earth.

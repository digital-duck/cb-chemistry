## Measurement

**Definition.** A *measurement* is a function $m: \mathcal{Q} \to \mathbb{R} \times U$ that assigns to a physical quantity $q \in \mathcal{Q}$ a numerical value $x \in \mathbb{R}$ together with a unit $u \in U$, such that the pair $(x, u)$ satisfies the invariance condition $m(q) = (x, u) \implies m(q) = (\lambda x, u/\lambda)$ for any positive scale factor $\lambda$ applied consistently to both the quantity and the unit. This invariance formalizes the intuitive requirement that a length is "5 meters" regardless of whether we choose to express it as "500 centimeters" — the underlying physical quantity is unchanged, only its numerical representation shifts.

**Worked example.** Suppose a rod has length $q$ such that $m(q) = (5, \text{m})$. Converting to centimeters, $\lambda = 100$, so $m(q) = (5 \cdot 100, \text{m}/100) = (500, \text{cm})$. Both expressions denote the same physical length, illustrating that measurement values are unit-dependent but the underlying quantity is unit-independent.

**Key theorem (Dimensional Consistency).** If $f(q_1, \ldots, q_n)$ is a physically meaningful function relating measured quantities, then $f$ must be expressible in a form invariant under simultaneous, consistent rescaling of all units — this is the content of the Buckingham $\pi$ theorem, which guarantees that any such relation can be rewritten in terms of dimensionless products $\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_k$.

**Lab cell (SymPy).**
```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational

# Convert 5 meters to centimeters
x, lam = symbols('x lambda', positive=True)
value_m = 5
lam_val = 100  # scale factor: 1 m = 100 cm

value_cm = value_m * lam_val
print(f"{value_m} m = {value_cm} cm")  # 5 m = 500 cm
```
```

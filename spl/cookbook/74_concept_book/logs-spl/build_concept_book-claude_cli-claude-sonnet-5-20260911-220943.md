## Oxidation Number

**Definition**

An oxidation number (or oxidation state) is a bookkeeping value assigned to an atom in a compound that represents the charge it would have if every bond were treated as fully ionic — that is, if all shared electrons were assigned to the more electronegative atom. It is not a real, measurable charge; it is an accounting convention that lets chemists track how electrons shift during a reaction. The rules are hierarchical: free elements are 0; monatomic ions equal their charge; oxygen is usually $-2$ (except peroxides, $-1$); hydrogen is usually $+1$ (except with metals, $-1$); fluorine is always $-1$; and the sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is 0, or equals the overall charge in a polyion.

**Worked example**

Find the oxidation number of manganese in $\text{KMnO}_4$. Potassium is a Group 1 metal, so it is $+1$. Oxygen follows its usual rule of $-2$, and there are four oxygens, contributing $-8$. Since the compound is neutral, the oxidation numbers must sum to zero:
$$(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0 \implies x = +7$$
So manganese is in the $+7$ oxidation state — a clue that $\text{KMnO}_4$ is a powerful oxidizing agent, since Mn(VII) can be reduced to lower, more stable states.

**Problem-solving application**

Oxidation numbers are most useful for identifying and balancing redox reactions, where tracking electron transfer by inspection is otherwise error-prone. Consider:
$$\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + \text{CO} \rightarrow \text{Fe} + \text{CO}_2$$
Assign oxidation numbers: Fe goes from $+3$ (in $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$) to $0$ (in Fe), a gain of 3 electrons per atom — reduction. Carbon goes from $+2$ (in CO) to $+4$ (in $\text{CO}_2$), a loss of 2 electrons — oxidation. To balance electrons lost and gained, you need 3 CO molecules (losing $3 \times 2 = 6$ electrons) for every 2 Fe atoms (gaining $2 \times 3 = 6$ electrons), giving the balanced equation $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 3\text{CO} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + 3\text{CO}_2$. This same technique — assign oxidation numbers, find what changes, match electrons transferred — is the standard first step for balancing any redox equation, including the more complex half-reaction method used in electrochemistry and titration problems.

## Oxidation

Oxidation is the loss of electrons by an atom, ion, or molecule during a chemical reaction. The term originated from reactions with oxygen, but the modern definition is broader: any species that loses electrons is oxidized, regardless of whether oxygen is involved. Oxidation always occurs together with reduction (electron gain) in what chemists call a redox reaction — electrons removed from one species must be accepted by another.

To track electron loss without drawing out every electron, chemists assign an **oxidation number** (or oxidation state) to each atom in a compound. This is a bookkeeping charge that an atom would have if all bonds were purely ionic. Rules include: elements in their natural form have an oxidation number of 0; oxygen is usually $-2$; hydrogen is usually $+1$; and the sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound equals 0 (or equals the ion's charge). When an atom's oxidation number increases, it has been oxidized.

**Worked example.** Consider the reaction:
$$
2\text{Mg} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{MgO}
$$
In elemental magnesium, Mg has an oxidation number of 0. In MgO, magnesium is $+2$ and oxygen is $-2$. Magnesium's oxidation number rose from $0$ to $+2$, so magnesium was oxidized — it lost two electrons to oxygen. Oxygen's number fell from $0$ to $-2$, so oxygen was reduced.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given the reaction $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + 2\text{Al} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe} + \text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ and asked to identify what is oxidized. Assign oxidation numbers: Al starts at 0 (elemental) and becomes $+3$ in $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$ — an increase, so aluminum is oxidized. Iron starts at $+3$ in $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ and drops to 0 as elemental Fe — a decrease, so iron is reduced. This systematic approach — assign oxidation numbers before and after, then compare — works for identifying oxidation in any reaction, from rusting metal to combustion to the electron-transfer steps inside a battery, where the oxidized species is the one that ends up donating electrons at the anode.

## Reduction

**Reduction** is the process of showing that one problem can be solved by transforming it into another problem you already know how to solve. Instead of designing a new algorithm from scratch, you write a procedure that converts any instance of Problem A into an instance of Problem B, solves it using an existing method for B, and then converts the answer back. Reduction is the workhorse of computer science and mathematics: it is how new problems get connected to a shared toolbox of known solutions, and it is also the primary technique for proving that a problem is *hard* — if a known-hard problem reduces to yours, yours is at least as hard.

**Worked example.** Suppose you need to find the *maximum* value in a list, but you only have a working function `find_min(list)` that returns the minimum. Rather than writing a new search routine, negate every number in the list, run `find_min` on the negated list, and negate the result again:

```python
def find_max(nums):
    negated = [-x for x in nums]
    return -find_min(negated)
```

This is a genuine reduction: "find the max" has been transformed into "find the min," with a cheap conversion step (negation) on both ends. The correctness of `find_max` now rests entirely on the correctness of `find_min` — you don't need to reprove anything about searching.

**Problem-solving application.** Reductions are especially powerful for classifying problem difficulty. In computer science, a problem $P$ is shown to be NP-hard by taking a problem already known to be NP-hard, such as Boolean satisfiability (SAT), and constructing a polynomial-time transformation from SAT into $P$. If such a reduction exists, then any efficient algorithm for $P$ would also give an efficient algorithm for SAT — so $P$ inherits SAT's difficulty. This is why, when you encounter an unfamiliar optimization problem (say, scheduling jobs on machines to minimize delay), a productive first move is to ask: does this look like a disguised version of a problem I already know, such as bin-packing or the traveling salesman problem? If you can build a mapping between the two, you immediately gain access to decades of existing algorithms, complexity results, and heuristics — turning an unsolved problem into a solved one in translation.

## Redox Reaction

A redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction is any chemical process in which electrons transfer between species, causing changes in oxidation states. Oxidation is the loss of electrons (oxidation number increases); reduction is the gain of electrons (oxidation number decreases). These two processes always occur together — one substance cannot lose electrons unless another accepts them. The substance that loses electrons is the reducing agent (it reduces the other species while being oxidized itself); the substance that gains electrons is the oxidizing agent.

**Worked example.** Consider the reaction between zinc metal and copper(II) sulfate solution:
$$\text{Zn}(s) + \text{Cu}^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}(aq) + \text{Cu}(s)$$

Assign oxidation states: zinc goes from $0$ to $+2$, losing two electrons (oxidation). Copper goes from $+2$ to $0$, gaining two electrons (reduction). Zinc is the reducing agent; $\text{Cu}^{2+}$ is the oxidizing agent. We can split this into two half-reactions, which must balance in electrons transferred:
$$\text{Zn} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^- \quad \text{(oxidation)}$$
$$\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu} \quad \text{(reduction)}$$
Adding them cancels the $2e^-$ on each side, confirming charge and mass balance — the core check for any redox equation.

**Problem-solving application.** The half-reaction method is the general tool for balancing redox equations, especially in acidic or basic solution where oxygen and hydrogen must also balance. Steps: (1) split into oxidation and reduction half-reactions; (2) balance atoms other than O and H; (3) balance O using $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, then H using $\text{H}^+$ (add $\text{OH}^-$ on both sides afterward if the reaction is basic); (4) balance charge with electrons; (5) multiply each half-reaction so electron counts match, then add and simplify.

This procedure isn't just bookkeeping — it's the basis for predicting whether a reaction will proceed spontaneously (via standard reduction potentials), designing batteries and electrolytic cells, understanding corrosion, and analyzing biological electron-transport chains. Any time you see a change in oxidation number — combustion, rusting, photosynthesis, respiration — you are looking at a redox process, and the half-reaction toolkit is how you quantify it.

## Combustion Reaction

A combustion reaction is a chemical process in which a substance—typically a hydrocarbon or other fuel—reacts rapidly with an oxidizer, usually molecular oxygen ($O_2$), releasing heat and light. Complete combustion of a hydrocarbon produces carbon dioxide and water as the only products. This is not just a memorized reaction type; it is a template for balancing chemical equations, which makes it a natural gateway to stoichiometry.

**Worked example.** Consider the complete combustion of propane, $C_3H_8$, a common fuel in portable grills and heaters. The unbalanced skeleton equation is:

$$C_3H_8 + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O$$

To balance it, work element by element. Carbon: 3 carbons on the left require 3 $CO_2$ on the right. Hydrogen: 8 hydrogens require 4 $H_2O$. Now count oxygen on the right: $3 \times 2 = 6$ from $CO_2$, plus $4 \times 1 = 4$ from $H_2O$, totaling 10 oxygen atoms, or 5 $O_2$ molecules. The balanced equation is:

$$C_3H_8 + 5O_2 \rightarrow 3CO_2 + 4H_2O$$

This reaction releases a large amount of heat, which is why propane is burned as a practical portable fuel.

**Problem-solving application.** Balancing combustion equations follows a predictable order: balance carbon first, then hydrogen, then oxygen last, since oxygen atoms are split between two product molecules and are easiest to adjust once the others are fixed. Try applying this to butane, $C_4H_{10}$: balancing carbon gives 4 $CO_2$, balancing hydrogen gives 5 $H_2O$, and counting oxygen (8 from $CO_2$ plus 5 from $H_2O$ = 13) means you need $\frac{13}{2}O_2$—often multiplied through by 2 to get whole-number coefficients: $2C_4H_{10} + 13O_2 \rightarrow 8CO_2 + 10H_2O$.

This same balancing logic underlies real engineering calculations, such as determining how much air a combustion engine or furnace needs to fully burn a given quantity of fuel, or estimating $CO_2$ emissions from fuel consumption—linking a simple bookkeeping skill directly to real-world systems.

## Payoff

Every concept in this book — atoms, moles, chemical formulas, balancing equations, stoichiometry — has been building toward a single moment: writing and using a **combustion reaction**. Combustion is the reaction of a fuel, typically a hydrocarbon $\text{C}_x\text{H}_y$ (sometimes with oxygen already in the molecule, as in alcohols), with oxygen gas to produce carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy:

$$\text{C}_x\text{H}_y\text{O}_z + \left(x + \frac{y}{4} - \frac{z}{2}\right)\text{O}_2 \rightarrow x\,\text{CO}_2 + \frac{y}{2}\,\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

This is the natural endpoint of the book because it forces you to use *everything* at once: you must know the formula of the fuel, balance the equation (often needing fractional-then-doubled coefficients), and apply stoichiometric ratios to move between grams, moles, and liters of reactants and products. No single skill from earlier chapters is enough on its own — combustion is where they synthesize into one calculation.

**Worked example.** Combust 44 g of propane, $\text{C}_3\text{H}_8$ (molar mass 44 g/mol, so this is exactly 1 mol):

$$\text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + 5\,\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 3\,\text{CO}_2 + 4\,\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

One mole of propane requires 5 mol O$_2$ and yields 3 mol CO$_2$ (132 g) and 4 mol H$_2$O (72 g). Mass balance checks: $44 + (5)(32) = 204$ g in; $132 + 72 = 204$ g out.

This is precisely the machinery **combustion analysis** depends on. In that application, chemists work in reverse: they burn an unknown organic compound completely, measure the mass of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O produced, and use the reaction stoichiometry above to determine how many moles of carbon and hydrogen (and by difference, oxygen) were in the original sample — ultimately recovering its empirical formula. Every tool in this chapter — balancing, molar mass, mole-to-mass conversion — is run in reverse to solve a real analytical problem: identifying an unknown substance from its combustion products.

**Try it yourself:** take a compound of unknown formula, imagine burning 0.500 g of it and collecting 0.733 g of CO$_2$ and 0.300 g of H$_2$O, and work backward to determine its empirical formula. That is combustion analysis in action — the payoff of everything you've learned.

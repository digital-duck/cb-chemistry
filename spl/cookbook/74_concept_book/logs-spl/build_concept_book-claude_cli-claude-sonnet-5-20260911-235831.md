## Proton Transfer

**Definition**

Proton transfer is the movement of a hydrogen ion, $H^+$, from one chemical species to another. It is the defining event of acid–base chemistry in the Brønsted–Lowry framework: an acid is any substance that donates a proton, and a base is any substance that accepts one. Because a bare proton is simply a nucleus with no electrons, it cannot exist alone in solution for any meaningful time — it is always captured by a lone pair on a nearby molecule the instant it is released. This means proton transfer reactions are really *coupled* events: one species loses $H^+$ while another gains it, essentially simultaneously.

$$\text{HA} + \text{B} \rightleftharpoons \text{A}^- + \text{HB}^+$$

Here HA is the acid (proton donor), B is the base (proton acceptor), and $A^-$/$HB^+$ are the resulting *conjugate base* and *conjugate acid*, respectively. Every acid–base reaction can be read as two conjugate pairs competing for the same proton.

**Worked example**

Consider ammonia dissolving in water:

$$NH_3 + H_2O \rightleftharpoons NH_4^+ + OH^-$$

Water donates a proton to ammonia's lone pair on nitrogen, becoming hydroxide; ammonia becomes the ammonium ion. Notice water acted as an acid here — but in the reaction $HCl + H_2O \rightarrow H_3O^+ + Cl^-$, water acts as a base instead. This dual capacity is called amphoterism, and it only makes sense once you view acid-base behavior as proton transfer rather than as a fixed label attached to a molecule.

**Problem-solving application**

To predict the direction a proton-transfer equilibrium favors, compare the relative strengths of the two acids involved: the reaction proceeds preferentially toward forming the *weaker* acid and *weaker* base, because those species hold their protons (or lack of protons) more stably. For example, given acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$, $pK_a \approx 4.76$) reacting with fluoride ion ($F^-$, conjugate base of HF, $pK_a \approx 3.2$):

$$CH_3COOH + F^- \rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^- + HF$$

Since HF ($pK_a = 3.2$) is a stronger acid than acetic acid ($pK_a = 4.76$), the equilibrium lies to the *left* — acetic acid retains its proton preferentially. This $pK_a$-comparison technique lets you predict outcomes for any Brønsted–Lowry pair without measuring a new equilibrium constant from scratch.

## Bronsted Lowry Acid

A Brønsted–Lowry acid is any substance that donates a proton, $\mathrm{H^+}$, to another substance in a chemical reaction. This definition, proposed independently by Johannes Brønsted and Thomas Lowry in 1923, broadened the older Arrhenius definition (which restricted acids to substances that release $\mathrm{H^+}$ specifically in water) to cover proton transfer in any solvent, or even in the gas phase. Every Brønsted–Lowry acid reaction requires a partner: the acid gives up a proton, and a base accepts it. This pairing means acids and bases are always defined relative to each other, and the same molecule can act as an acid in one reaction and a base in another.

Consider the reaction between hydrochloric acid and ammonia:

$$\mathrm{HCl + NH_3 \rightarrow Cl^- + NH_4^+}$$

Here, $\mathrm{HCl}$ donates a proton to $\mathrm{NH_3}$, so $\mathrm{HCl}$ is the Brønsted–Lowry acid and $\mathrm{NH_3}$ is the base. After the transfer, $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ and $\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ form a conjugate acid–base pair with the original species: $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ is the conjugate base of $\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\mathrm{NH_4^+}$ is the conjugate acid of $\mathrm{NH_3}$. Notice that no water is involved at all, which is exactly the kind of reaction the Arrhenius definition could not classify.

The practical value of this definition shows up when you need to identify acids and bases in unfamiliar reactions, especially ones involving polyprotic species or amphoteric substances. Take bicarbonate, $\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$, reacting with hydronium:

$$\mathrm{HCO_3^- + H_3O^+ \rightarrow H_2CO_3 + H_2O}$$

Here $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$ donates a proton and acts as the acid, while $\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$ accepts it and acts as the base. But in a different reaction, bicarbonate can donate a proton to hydroxide instead:

$$\mathrm{HCO_3^- + OH^- \rightarrow CO_3^{2-} + H_2O}$$

Now $\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$ is the acid. To solve problems involving proton transfer, first identify which species has an $\mathrm{H}$ available to donate and which species has a lone pair or negative site ready to accept it; the direction of transfer tells you which is the acid and which is the base in that specific reaction, regardless of how the same molecule behaved elsewhere.

## Bronsted Lowry Base

A Brønsted-Lowry base is any species that accepts a proton ($\text{H}^+$) in a chemical reaction. This definition, proposed independently in 1923 by Johannes Brønsted and Thomas Lowry, is broader than the earlier Arrhenius definition, which restricted bases to substances that release hydroxide ions ($\text{OH}^-$) in water. Under the Brønsted-Lowry framework, a base only needs a lone pair of electrons capable of forming a bond with $\text{H}^+$ — it does not need to contain hydroxide at all, and the reaction does not need to occur in water. Ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$), for example, has no $\text{OH}^-$ group, yet it acts as a base because its nitrogen lone pair grabs a proton.

Consider the reaction of ammonia with water:

$$\text{NH}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{OH}^-$$

Here, $\text{NH}_3$ accepts a proton from water, becoming the ammonium ion $\text{NH}_4^+$. Water, having donated the proton, is the acid in this reaction. This exchange also introduces the idea of conjugate acid-base pairs: $\text{NH}_3$ and $\text{NH}_4^+$ form one pair, while $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ and $\text{OH}^-$ form another. Every Brønsted-Lowry base has a conjugate acid formed the instant it accepts a proton.

This proton-transfer lens is essential for solving problems that the Arrhenius model cannot handle. Suppose you are asked to identify the base in the reaction:

$$\text{HCO}_3^- + \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ \rightleftharpoons \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

Using the Brønsted-Lowry definition, you track where the proton goes: $\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$ hands off a proton, becoming $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, so $\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$ is the acid. $\text{HCO}_3^-$ receives that proton, becoming $\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$, making $\text{HCO}_3^-$ the base. Notice that in a different reaction, $\text{HCO}_3^-$ could instead donate a proton and act as an acid — this dual capacity is called amphoterism, and identifying it correctly depends entirely on tracking proton movement rather than memorizing a fixed list of "basic" substances.

When solving equilibrium or titration problems, always ask: which species is gaining an $\text{H}^+$? That species is the base, regardless of whether hydroxide is present, and its conjugate acid is simply the base plus one proton.

---

## Conjugate Acid Base Pair

According to the Brønsted-Lowry definition, an acid is a species that donates a proton ($\text{H}^+$), and a base is a species that accepts one. A **conjugate acid-base pair** consists of two species that differ from each other by exactly one proton: the acid on one side of a reaction and the base it becomes after losing that proton (or vice versa). Every acid has a conjugate base, and every base has a conjugate acid, formed simultaneously in the same reaction.

**Worked example.** Consider acetic acid dissolving in water:

$$\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_3\text{O}^+$$

Here $\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$ donates a proton to water, so it is the acid; its conjugate base is $\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-$, the species left behind after losing $\text{H}^+$. Water accepts the proton, acting as the base; its conjugate acid is $\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$. Notice the two pairs: $\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}/\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-$ and $\text{H}_2\text{O}/\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$. In each pair, the two members differ only by one $\text{H}^+$, and the reaction is reversible — the conjugate base can reclaim a proton to reform the acid, which is why a double arrow is used.

**Problem-solving application.** The main skill to practice is identifying conjugate pairs directly from a chemical equation, without needing to memorize which species is "supposed" to be the acid. Given any proton-transfer reaction, scan for a species that loses an $\text{H}$ atom (becoming the conjugate base) and match it with the species that gains that same $\text{H}$ (becoming the conjugate acid of whatever donated it). For example, in the reaction of ammonia with water,

$$\text{NH}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{OH}^-$$

water is now the acid (donating $\text{H}^+$ to become $\text{OH}^-$), while ammonia is the base (accepting $\text{H}^+$ to become $\text{NH}_4^+$). This shows that water's role — acid or base — depends on its reaction partner, a property called amphoterism. Recognizing conjugate pairs is essential for predicting the direction of acid-base equilibria: a strong acid's conjugate base is weak, and a weak acid's conjugate base is comparatively stronger, which determines which side of the equilibrium is favored.

## Acid Ionization

Acid ionization describes what happens when an acid dissolves in water: the acid molecule donates a proton ($\text{H}^+$) to a water molecule, producing a hydronium ion ($\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$) and the acid's conjugate base. For a generic weak acid $\text{HA}$:

$$\text{HA}(aq) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \text{H}_3\text{O}^+(aq) + \text{A}^-(aq)$$

Because this is an equilibrium, not a one-way reaction, only some fraction of the acid molecules actually ionize. That fraction is governed by the acid ionization constant, $K_a$:

$$K_a = \frac{[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+][\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}$$

A large $K_a$ (much greater than 1) means the equilibrium lies far to the right — the acid ionizes almost completely, which is why we classify it as a *strong* acid (e.g., HCl, $\text{HNO}_3$). A small $K_a$ means most of the acid stays intact in molecular form, characteristic of a *weak* acid (e.g., acetic acid, $K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}$).

**Worked example.** Suppose you dissolve 0.10 M acetic acid ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$) in water. Set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium), letting $x = [\text{H}_3\text{O}^+]$ at equilibrium:

$$K_a = \frac{x^2}{0.10 - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.10} = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}$$

The approximation $0.10 - x \approx 0.10$ is valid because $K_a$ is small, so ionization is minimal. Solving: $x^2 = 1.8 \times 10^{-6}$, so $x = [\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-3}$ M. Then $\text{pH} = -\log(1.3 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 2.88$. Note this is far less acidic than a 0.10 M strong acid, which would give pH = 1.00 exactly, because nearly all of a strong acid ionizes while only about 1.3% of the acetic acid does here.

**Problem-solving application.** $K_a$ calculations let you predict pH, buffer behavior, and titration curves without running an experiment. A common task: given a measured pH, work backward to find $K_a$ for an unknown acid — useful in identifying substances or verifying purity. Another: compare two acids' $K_a$ values to predict which will react more vigorously with a base, or which conjugate base will be the stronger base (since $K_a \times K_b = K_w$ for a conjugate pair). Mastering the ICE-table approach here is the same skill used later for any weak-acid/weak-base equilibrium problem.

## Chemical Equilibrium

Chemical equilibrium describes the state a reversible reaction reaches when the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, so the measurable concentrations of reactants and products stop changing. This is a *dynamic* balance, not a stationary one: molecules keep converting in both directions, but the net composition holds steady. For a general reaction $aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD$, the equilibrium condition is captured by the equilibrium constant expression:

$$K_c = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$

where bracketed terms are equilibrium molar concentrations. $K_c$ is fixed at a given temperature; its value tells you whether products or reactants are favored at equilibrium (large $K_c$ means mostly products; small $K_c$ means mostly reactants). This law of mass action is genuinely a mathematical result — it follows from equating forward and reverse reaction rates — so the notation is necessary here, not decorative.

**Worked example.** Consider the reaction $\text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3(g)$ with $K_c = 0.50$ at some temperature. Suppose at equilibrium $[\text{N}_2] = 1.0\ \text{M}$, $[\text{H}_2] = 2.0\ \text{M}$. Solve for $[\text{NH}_3]$:

$$0.50 = \frac{[\text{NH}_3]^2}{(1.0)(2.0)^3} \implies [\text{NH}_3]^2 = 0.50 \times 8.0 = 4.0 \implies [\text{NH}_3] = 2.0\ \text{M}$$

**Problem-solving application.** A common exam-style task is predicting how a system responds to disturbance, using Le Chatelier's principle alongside the equilibrium expression. Suppose you compress the container above, doubling all concentrations at equilibrium. Compute the reaction quotient $Q_c$ using the new concentrations and compare it to $K_c$: if $Q_c < K_c$, the reaction shifts forward (toward products) to restore equilibrium; if $Q_c > K_c$, it shifts backward. This $Q$-versus-$K$ comparison is the standard problem-solving tool chemists and engineers use — in industrial ammonia synthesis, wastewater treatment, and blood pH buffering alike — to predict shifts before doing detailed calculations, then confirm the direction quantitatively by resolving for new equilibrium concentrations using an ICE (Initial–Change–Equilibrium) table.

## Acid Ionization Constant Ka

When a weak acid $\text{HA}$ dissolves in water, it does not fully dissociate. Instead, it establishes an equilibrium:

$$\text{HA}(aq) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \text{H}_3\text{O}^+(aq) + \text{A}^-(aq)$$

The **acid ionization constant**, $K_a$, quantifies the position of this equilibrium:

$$K_a = \frac{[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+][\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}$$

Water is omitted because its concentration is treated as constant in dilute solution. A larger $K_a$ means the equilibrium favors products — the acid ionizes more extensively and is therefore stronger. Because $K_a$ values span many orders of magnitude, chemists often report $\text{p}K_a = -\log_{10}K_a$; smaller $\text{p}K_a$ corresponds to a stronger acid.

**Worked example.** Acetic acid ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$) has $K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}$. Suppose we prepare a 0.10 M solution and let $x$ be the equilibrium concentration of $\text{H}_3\text{O}^+$ produced. Then $[\text{A}^-] = x$ and $[\text{HA}] \approx 0.10 - x$. Substituting:

$$1.8 \times 10^{-5} = \frac{x^2}{0.10 - x}$$

Since $K_a$ is small, ionization is minor, so $0.10 - x \approx 0.10$:

$$x^2 = (1.8\times 10^{-5})(0.10) = 1.8\times 10^{-6} \implies x \approx 1.34\times 10^{-3}\ \text{M}$$

This gives $\text{pH} = -\log(1.34\times 10^{-3}) \approx 2.87$. Checking the approximation, $x/0.10 = 1.3\%$, well under the usual 5% tolerance, so the simplification is valid.

**Problem-solving application.** $K_a$ lets you predict pH from concentration, or work backward: if you measure the pH of an unknown weak acid solution, you can solve for $K_a$ and identify the acid or assess its purity. It also governs buffer behavior — the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, $\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log([\text{A}^-]/[\text{HA}])$, is derived directly from the $K_a$ expression. When solving these problems, always set up an ICE (Initial–Change–Equilibrium) table first, check whether the small-$x$ approximation is valid, and use the quadratic formula instead when $K_a$ is not small relative to the initial concentration.

## Hydronium Ion

Pure water is never made only of $H_2O$ molecules. A small fraction of them react with each other in a process called autoionization: one water molecule donates a proton ($H^+$) to another. The molecule that gains the proton becomes a hydronium ion, $H_3O^+$, while the one that lost it becomes a hydroxide ion, $OH^-$:

$$2\,H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + OH^-$$

A bare proton, $H^+$, is far too reactive to exist alone in water — it is essentially a hydrogen nucleus with no electrons. Instead, it immediately attaches to the lone pair of electrons on a neighboring water molecule's oxygen atom, forming $H_3O^+$. This is why chemists write "$H^+$(aq)" as shorthand but mean $H_3O^+$ in practice: acidity in water is really about hydronium concentration, not free protons.

**Worked example.** At $25^\circ\text{C}$, pure water has $[H_3O^+] = [OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{M}$, since the two ions are always produced in equal amounts by autoionization. This gives $\text{pH} = -\log(1.0\times10^{-7}) = 7.0$, the familiar neutral pH.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you dissolve hydrochloric acid in water so that $[H_3O^+] = 2.5 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{M}$. Two things follow. First, the pH is $-\log(2.5\times10^{-3}) \approx 2.60$ — noticeably acidic. Second, because water's ion product $K_w = [H_3O^+][OH^-] = 1.0\times10^{-14}$ holds at equilibrium regardless of what acid or base you add, you can immediately find the hydroxide concentration:

$$[OH^-] = \frac{K_w}{[H_3O^+]} = \frac{1.0\times10^{-14}}{2.5\times10^{-3}} = 4.0\times10^{-12}\ \text{M}$$

This is the key problem-solving move: given either ion concentration, you always know the other, because adding acid suppresses $[OH^-]$ even as it raises $[H_3O^+]$ — the two shift in opposite directions to keep their product constant. This relationship underlies pH calculations throughout acid–base chemistry, from titration curves to buffer design, and explains why "acidic" and "basic" solutions still contain both ions, just in very different proportions.

---

## Le Chateliers Principle

When a chemical system at equilibrium is disturbed, it responds in a way that partially counteracts the disturbance and re-establishes equilibrium. This qualitative rule, formulated by Henri Le Chatelier in 1884, does not tell you the new equilibrium concentrations directly, but it correctly predicts the *direction* a reaction will shift in response to three common stresses: a change in concentration, a change in pressure or volume (for gases), or a change in temperature.

**Worked example.** Consider the industrial synthesis of ammonia:
$$\text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3(g) \quad \Delta H = -92\ \text{kJ/mol}$$
This reaction is exothermic and converts 4 moles of gas into 2 moles of gas. Suppose the system is at equilibrium and we increase the pressure by compressing the container. The system will shift toward the side with fewer gas moles — the product side — because that partially relieves the increased pressure by reducing the total number of gas particles. If instead we raise the temperature, the equilibrium shifts left (toward reactants), since the reverse reaction is endothermic and absorbs the added heat, counteracting the temperature increase. Notice the two stresses push in opposite directions here, which is exactly why industrial ammonia production (the Haber process) balances moderate pressure and moderate temperature rather than maximizing either.

**Problem-solving application.** To apply Le Chatelier's principle systematically, ask three questions in sequence: (1) *What was added or removed?* Adding a reactant shifts the reaction toward products (and vice versa for removing a reactant); the system consumes the excess or replaces the deficit. (2) *Did volume or pressure change?* For gas-phase reactions, compressing the system favors the side with fewer moles of gas; expanding favors the side with more. Reactions with equal moles of gas on both sides are unaffected by pressure changes. (3) *Did temperature change?* Treat heat as a reactant (exothermic) or product (endothermic) and apply the same logic as concentration changes — increasing temperature shifts equilibrium toward whichever side absorbs heat.

A useful check: a catalyst speeds up both forward and reverse reactions equally, so it never shifts equilibrium position — only the rate at which equilibrium is reached. Recognizing this distinction between rate and position is often what separates a correct Le Chatelier prediction from a common student error.

---

## Ph Scale

The pH scale measures how acidic or basic (alkaline) a water-based solution is, based on the concentration of hydrogen ions, $\text{H}^+$, dissolved in it. Because hydrogen ion concentrations in real solutions can range across many orders of magnitude — from about $1$ mol/L in a strong acid to $10^{-14}$ mol/L in a strong base — chemists use a logarithmic scale to keep the numbers manageable. The defining relationship is

$$\text{pH} = -\log_{10}[\text{H}^+]$$

where $[\text{H}^+]$ is the hydrogen ion concentration in moles per liter. Because of the negative logarithm, a *higher* $[\text{H}^+]$ produces a *lower* pH. The scale runs roughly from 0 to 14: values below 7 are acidic, 7 is neutral (pure water), and values above 7 are basic. Each single unit on the scale represents a tenfold change in $[\text{H}^+]$ — pH 4 is ten times more acidic than pH 5, and one hundred times more acidic than pH 6.

**Worked example.** Suppose a sample of lemon juice has $[\text{H}^+] = 5 \times 10^{-3}$ mol/L. Its pH is

$$\text{pH} = -\log_{10}(5 \times 10^{-3}) = -(\log_{10} 5 + \log_{10} 10^{-3}) = -(0.70 - 3) = 2.3$$

This matches the known acidity of citrus juice, which typically falls between pH 2 and 3.

**Problem-solving application.** The logarithmic structure of pH means you often need to convert *between* pH and concentration, not just compute pH from a given concentration. To reverse the formula, exponentiate both sides: $[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}$. For instance, if a water sample tests at pH 8.1 (typical of ocean water), then $[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-8.1} \approx 7.9 \times 10^{-9}$ mol/L.

This inverse relationship is essential in real-world monitoring problems. Ocean acidification research, for example, tracks small pH drops — say from 8.2 to 8.1 — that actually represent roughly a 26% *increase* in $[\text{H}^+]$, a change large enough to stress coral and shellfish. Similarly, in medicine, blood pH is tightly regulated near 7.4; a shift of just a few tenths of a unit signals a serious physiological imbalance. Whenever you encounter a pH change in a problem, resist the instinct to treat it additively — always convert back to concentration first to judge the true magnitude of the change.

---

## Buffer Solution

A buffer solution resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added to it. This resistance comes from a specific composition: a buffer contains a weak acid together with its conjugate base (or a weak base together with its conjugate acid) in comparable concentrations. Because both species are present simultaneously, the solution has a built-in reserve that can neutralize incoming $\text{H}^+$ or $\text{OH}^-$ ions without producing a large swing in pH.

The quantitative relationship governing buffers is the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation:

$$\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right)$$

where $\text{HA}$ is the weak acid and $\text{A}^-$ is its conjugate base. This equation is essential here because a buffer's behavior is fundamentally a statement about equilibrium ratios, and no amount of prose substitutes for tracking how that ratio shifts.

**Worked example.** Suppose you prepare a buffer from acetic acid ($K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}$, so $\text{p}K_a = 4.74$) with $[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = 0.20\ \text{M}$ and $[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.20\ \text{M}$. Since the ratio is 1, $\log(1) = 0$, so $\text{pH} = 4.74$. Now add a small amount of strong base, enough to convert 0.02 M of the acid into its conjugate base. The new concentrations are $[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = 0.18\ \text{M}$ and $[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.22\ \text{M}$. Plugging in:

$$\text{pH} = 4.74 + \log\left(\frac{0.22}{0.18}\right) = 4.74 + 0.087 \approx 4.83$$

The pH shifted by less than 0.1 units — compare this to adding the same amount of base to pure water, which would jump the pH by several units.

**Problem-solving application.** Buffers are used whenever a system must maintain a stable pH despite ongoing chemical activity: human blood uses a carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer to stay near pH 7.4 despite metabolic acid production; biochemists use phosphate or Tris buffers to keep enzyme reactions at their optimal pH; and industrial processes use buffers to protect sensitive reactions from pH drift. When solving buffer problems, always start by identifying the weak acid/base pair, find or look up its $\text{p}K_a$, and then use the desired pH to solve for the required ratio of conjugate base to acid — this ratio, not the absolute concentrations, is what determines the pH, though total concentration determines buffer capacity.

---

## Henderson Hasselbalch Equation

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the pH of a buffer solution to the ratio of its conjugate base and weak acid concentrations. It is derived from the equilibrium expression for a weak acid dissociation, $HA \rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$, with equilibrium constant $K_a = \dfrac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$. Taking the negative logarithm of both sides and rearranging gives:

$$\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log_{10}\left(\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\right)$$

Here, $[A^-]$ is the concentration of the conjugate base (the proton acceptor) and $[HA]$ is the concentration of the undissociated weak acid. The equation works because a buffer's pH depends not on the absolute amounts of acid and base present, but on their ratio — this is why buffers resist pH change when small amounts of acid or base are added.

**Worked example.** Consider an acetate buffer made from acetic acid ($\text{p}K_a = 4.76$) with $[A^-] = 0.30\ \text{M}$ and $[HA] = 0.10\ \text{M}$. Substituting into the equation:

$$\text{pH} = 4.76 + \log_{10}(0.30/0.10) = 4.76 + \log_{10}(3) = 4.76 + 0.48 = 5.24$$

Notice that when $[A^-] = [HA]$, the log term is zero and $\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a$ exactly — this is the point of maximum buffering capacity, since the solution has equal reserves of acid and base to neutralize incoming base or acid.

**Problem-solving application.** The equation is most useful in reverse: given a target pH, determine the ratio of components needed to prepare a buffer. Suppose a biochemist needs a phosphate buffer at pH 7.40 using a conjugate pair with $\text{p}K_a = 7.20$. Rearranging:

$$\log_{10}\left(\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\right) = 7.40 - 7.20 = 0.20 \implies \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{0.20} \approx 1.58$$

So the base form should be about 1.58 times the concentration of the acid form. This calculation is routine in pharmacology (drug ionization at physiological pH), cell biology (culture media preparation), and environmental science (predicting how ocean pH shifts alter the carbonate/bicarbonate buffer ratio). Note also that the equation is only reliable when $[A^-]$ and $[HA]$ are both well above the buffer's dilution limits — at very low concentrations, water's own autoionization interferes with the approximation.

---

## Blood Buffer System

Human metabolism runs within a narrow window of blood pH, roughly 7.35 to 7.45. Even small departures from this range disrupt enzyme function and protein structure, so the body relies on chemical buffers — solutions that resist changes in pH when acid or base is added — to hold the line. The dominant buffer in blood plasma is the bicarbonate system, an equilibrium between dissolved carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, and bicarbonate ion:

$$\mathrm{CO_2(dissolved)} + \mathrm{H_2O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H_2CO_3} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H^+} + \mathrm{HCO_3^-}$$

This system resists pH change through Le Chatelier's principle: if acid is added, excess $\mathrm{H^+}$ combines with $\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$ to form more carbonic acid, which shifts left and reduces the free $\mathrm{H^+}$ increase. If base is added, the equilibrium shifts right, generating more $\mathrm{H^+}$ to neutralize it. The relationship between the buffer's components and pH is captured by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

$$\mathrm{pH} = pK_a + \log\left(\frac{[\mathrm{HCO_3^-}]}{[\mathrm{CO_2}]}\right)$$

With a $pK_a$ of about 6.1 for this system, a healthy 20:1 ratio of bicarbonate to dissolved $\mathrm{CO_2}$ yields the target pH of 7.4.

**Worked example.** Suppose a patient's plasma bicarbonate is 24 mmol/L and dissolved $\mathrm{CO_2}$ is 1.2 mmol/L. Plugging into the equation: $\mathrm{pH} = 6.1 + \log(24/1.2) = 6.1 + \log(20) = 6.1 + 1.30 = 7.40$ — normal.

**Problem-solving application.** The power of this equation is diagnostic: clinicians measure $\mathrm{CO_2}$ (controlled by breathing rate) and bicarbonate (controlled by the kidneys) separately, then use the ratio to classify acid-base disorders. If a patient hyperventilates, $\mathrm{CO_2}$ drops, raising the ratio and pushing pH up — respiratory alkalosis. If the kidneys fail to regenerate bicarbonate, the ratio falls and pH drops — metabolic acidosis. Given a patient with $[\mathrm{HCO_3^-}] = 12$ mmol/L and $[\mathrm{CO_2}] = 1.2$ mmol/L, you can calculate $\mathrm{pH} = 6.1 + \log(10) = 7.1$, confirming acidosis and prompting treatment aimed at restoring bicarbonate or increasing ventilation to blow off $\mathrm{CO_2}$. This equation turns two easily measured lab values into a quantitative, actionable diagnosis.

## Payoff

The blood buffer system is where equilibrium chemistry stops being an abstraction and becomes the reason you are alive. Blood must hold its pH between 7.35 and 7.45 despite a constant chemical assault: cellular respiration dumping $\mathrm{CO_2}$ into the bloodstream every second, muscles releasing lactic acid during exercise, the kidneys and diet adding acids and bases unpredictably. A swing of even 0.3 pH units in either direction can be fatal, because the proteins and enzymes that run your metabolism are folded into shapes that only work within a narrow pH range. The bicarbonate buffer system, $\mathrm{H_2CO_3} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H^+} + \mathrm{HCO_3^-}$, is what absorbs this chemical noise and keeps the internal environment stable enough for every other biological process to function. It is the natural endpoint of this book because it is the concept where equilibrium, acid–base chemistry, and physiology converge into a single system that you can now analyze quantitatively rather than just describe.

This convergence is exactly what makes the concept unlock so many downstream applications. In *clinical medicine*, understanding the buffer equation lets you interpret arterial blood gas panels and diagnose conditions like metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis by reasoning about which side of the equilibrium has shifted. In *pharmacology*, the same equilibrium principles explain why drug absorption and ionization depend on the pH of blood and tissue, which determines dosing and formulation. In *exercise physiology*, buffer capacity explains the biochemical limits of endurance — why lactic acid accumulation eventually overwhelms the system and forces fatigue. In *environmental and comparative physiology*, the same buffering logic reappears in ocean chemistry, where dissolved $\mathrm{CO_2}$ shifts the carbonate equilibrium and drives ocean acidification, showing that the mechanism keeping your blood stable is the same one governing the health of marine ecosystems.

Seeing one equilibrium reaction explain hospital diagnostics, drug design, athletic performance, and planetary chemistry is the payoff of studying acid–base systems rigorously rather than superficially. From here, the natural next step is to explore one of these applications in depth — arterial blood gas interpretation is the most direct extension, since it lets you apply the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation to real clinical data and see the buffer system diagnose disease in practice.

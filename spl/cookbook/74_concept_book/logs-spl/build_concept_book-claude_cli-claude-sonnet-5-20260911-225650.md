## Intermolecular Forces

**Definition.** Intermolecular forces are the attractions that act *between* molecules, distinct from the covalent or ionic bonds that hold atoms together *within* a molecule. Three main types matter for most chemistry problems. London dispersion forces arise in all molecules from momentary, shifting imbalances in electron distribution, and grow stronger with more electrons and larger, more polarizable surface area. Dipole-dipole forces occur between molecules with a permanent unequal sharing of electrons (a dipole), where the partially positive end of one molecule attracts the partially negative end of another. Hydrogen bonding, the strongest of the three, occurs when a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (N, O, or F) is attracted to a lone pair on a nearby electronegative atom. The strength ordering is generally hydrogen bonding > dipole-dipole > dispersion, though large enough molecules can have dispersion forces that outweigh dipole-dipole forces in smaller ones.

**Worked example.** Compare the boiling points of butane ($\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}$, bp $-1\,^\circ\text{C}$) and diethyl ether ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OC}_2\text{H}_5$, bp $35\,^\circ\text{C}$), two molecules of similar molar mass. Butane is nonpolar, so its molecules interact only through dispersion forces. Diethyl ether has a bent C–O–C arrangement with an oxygen atom that gives it a net dipole, adding dipole-dipole attraction on top of dispersion forces. Because boiling requires overcoming intermolecular attractions, the ether's additional dipole-dipole interaction demands more thermal energy, explaining its higher boiling point despite comparable size.

**Problem-solving application.** When ranking boiling or melting points, work through molecules in this order: first check for O–H or N–H bonds (hydrogen bonding present); if absent, check for a permanent dipole from unequal electronegativity and asymmetric shape (dipole-dipole present); if the molecule is symmetric and nonpolar, only dispersion forces apply, and size/surface area become the deciding factor. For example, predict which boils higher: methanol ($\text{CH}_3\text{OH}$) or ethane ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_6$), both with similar molar mass. Methanol has an O–H bond capable of hydrogen bonding; ethane has only dispersion forces. Methanol's boiling point ($65\,^\circ\text{C}$) is far higher than ethane's ($-89\,^\circ\text{C}$), confirming the rule. This stepwise check — hydrogen bonding, then dipole, then dispersion — is the reliable strategy for predicting relative physical properties from molecular structure alone.

## Solution

A **solution** is any value, or set of values, that makes an equation, inequality, or system of equations true when substituted for the unknown(s). Solving is the process of finding that value systematically, rather than guessing. Every solution must be verifiable: substituting it back into the original problem should produce a true statement. This verification step is what separates a rigorous solution from a lucky guess.

**Worked example.** Consider the linear equation $3x - 7 = 2x + 5$. To solve, isolate $x$ by performing the same operation on both sides. Subtract $2x$ from both sides: $x - 7 = 5$. Add 7 to both sides: $x = 12$. Check: $3(12) - 7 = 29$ and $2(12) + 5 = 29$. Both sides match, so $x = 12$ is confirmed as the solution.

Now consider a slightly harder case: the quadratic $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$. Factoring gives $(x-2)(x-3) = 0$, so $x = 2$ and $x = 3$ are both solutions — a reminder that a "solution" need not be unique. Substituting each value back confirms both satisfy the original equation.

**Problem-solving application.** In practice, most real problems don't arrive as a clean equation — they arrive as a scenario, and translating the scenario into an equation is the actual skill being tested. Suppose a rectangular garden's length is 3 meters more than its width, and its area is 40 square meters. Let $w$ represent the width; then the length is $w + 3$, and the area equation is $w(w+3) = 40$, or $w^2 + 3w - 40 = 0$. Factoring gives $(w+8)(w-5) = 0$, yielding $w = -8$ or $w = 5$. Here the algebra produces two mathematically valid roots, but only one is a valid *solution to the problem*: width cannot be negative, so $w = -8$ is rejected on physical grounds, leaving $w = 5$ meters (and length 8 meters) as the answer.

This distinction — between an equation's roots and a problem's admissible solutions — is central to applied problem-solving. Always check candidate solutions against both the original equation and the real-world constraints (domain restrictions, sign conventions, units) that the equation was built to represent.

## Molality

Molality ($m$) measures the concentration of a solution as moles of solute per kilogram of solvent:

$$m = \frac{n_{\text{solute}}}{m_{\text{solvent}} \, (\text{kg})}$$

Molality differs from molarity in a way that matters for real applications: molarity depends on the total volume of solution, which changes with temperature as liquids expand or contract. Molality depends only on mass, which is temperature-independent. This makes molality the preferred unit whenever a calculation must hold across a range of temperatures — most importantly, in colligative property calculations like freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation.

**Worked example.** Suppose you dissolve 34.2 g of sucrose ($\text{C}_{12}\text{H}_{22}\text{O}_{11}$, molar mass 342.3 g/mol) in 500 g of water. First find moles of solute:

$$n = \frac{34.2\ \text{g}}{342.3\ \text{g/mol}} = 0.100\ \text{mol}$$

Convert solvent mass to kilograms: $500\ \text{g} = 0.500\ \text{kg}$. Then:

$$m = \frac{0.100\ \text{mol}}{0.500\ \text{kg}} = 0.200\ \text{mol/kg} = 0.200\ m$$

**Problem-solving application.** Molality's real payoff is in predicting how a solute shifts a solvent's phase-change temperature. The freezing-point depression law states:

$$\Delta T_f = i \, K_f \, m$$

where $K_f$ is the solvent's freezing-point depression constant (for water, $1.86\ °\text{C·kg/mol}$) and $i$ is the van't Hoff factor — the number of particles the solute dissociates into (1 for sucrose, 2 for NaCl, 3 for CaCl$_2$).

Suppose you want to prevent a car's coolant (water-based) from freezing above $-10.0\ °\text{C}$ using ethylene glycol (non-dissociating, $i = 1$). Solve for the required molality:

$$m = \frac{\Delta T_f}{K_f} = \frac{10.0\ °\text{C}}{1.86\ °\text{C·kg/mol}} = 5.38\ \text{mol/kg}$$

This tells an engineer exactly how many moles of glycol must be added per kilogram of water — independent of how the mixture's volume changes as it cools. This is precisely why antifreeze formulations, road de-icing salts, and cryopreservation protocols are all specified in molality rather than molarity: the calculation must remain valid as temperature — and therefore volume — changes.

## Colligative Property

A colligative property is a physical property of a solution that depends on the *number* of dissolved solute particles relative to the amount of solvent, but not on the *identity* of those particles. Whether the solute is sugar, salt, or ethylene glycol, what matters is how many particles it contributes to the solution — not its chemical nature. The four classic colligative properties are vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure. Each arises because adding solute particles dilutes the solvent's presence at the surface or interferes with its ability to form an ordered solid phase, shifting the equilibrium conditions.

The freezing point depression is a useful entry point because it is easy to compute and directly applicable: $\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m$, where $m$ is the molality of the solution, $K_f$ is the solvent's freezing point depression constant, and $i$ is the van't Hoff factor — the number of particles each formula unit produces upon dissolving (for glucose, $i = 1$; for NaCl, $i \approx 2$, since it dissociates into Na⁺ and Cl⁻).

**Worked example.** Suppose you dissolve 58.5 g of NaCl (molar mass 58.5 g/mol, so 1 mol) in 1.0 kg of water. The molality is $m = 1.0\ \text{mol/kg}$. Water's $K_f = 1.86\ ^\circ\text{C·kg/mol}$. Since NaCl dissociates into two ions, $i = 2$. Then $\Delta T_f = 2 \times 1.86 \times 1.0 = 3.72\ ^\circ\text{C}$, so the solution freezes at $-3.72\ ^\circ\text{C}$ instead of $0\ ^\circ\text{C}$.

**Problem-solving application.** This is exactly why road crews spread salt on icy pavement: the dissolved ions lower the freezing point of the water film on the road, keeping it liquid at temperatures where pure water would freeze. Similarly, antifreeze (ethylene glycol) in a car radiator both raises the boiling point and lowers the freezing point of the coolant, since it doesn't dissociate ($i=1$) but still contributes particles. When solving colligative property problems, always identify $i$ correctly first — forgetting that ionic compounds dissociate is the most common source of error — then apply the appropriate formula for the property in question (freezing point, boiling point, or osmotic pressure) using consistent concentration units.

## Molarity

Molarity is a way of expressing how concentrated a solution is — how much solute is dissolved in a given volume of solvent. Formally, molarity ($M$) is defined as the number of moles of solute divided by the volume of solution in liters:

$$M = \frac{n}{V}$$

where $n$ is the amount of solute in moles and $V$ is the total volume of solution in liters. The units of molarity are $\text{mol/L}$, often written simply as $M$ (for example, "a 2 M solution of NaCl" means 2 moles of NaCl per liter of solution). Because molarity relates an amount of substance (moles) to a measured volume, it requires this precise mathematical definition — there is no purely qualitative way to describe "how concentrated" a solution is that would let you calculate reaction quantities.

**Worked example.** Suppose you dissolve 58.5 g of table salt (NaCl, molar mass $58.5 \text{ g/mol}$) in enough water to make 2.0 L of solution. First, convert mass to moles:

$$n = \frac{58.5\text{ g}}{58.5\text{ g/mol}} = 1.0 \text{ mol}$$

Then apply the definition of molarity:

$$M = \frac{1.0 \text{ mol}}{2.0 \text{ L}} = 0.5 \text{ M}$$

So the solution has a concentration of 0.5 mol/L.

**Problem-solving application.** Molarity becomes especially useful when diluting a stock solution to a weaker one — a routine task in labs, from preparing buffers in biology to titrations in analytical chemistry. When you add water to a solution, the volume increases but the amount of solute (in moles) stays exactly the same. Since $n = MV$ from the definition above, this means the product $MV$ before dilution must equal the product $MV$ after dilution:

$$M_1 V_1 = M_2 V_2$$

For instance, if you have 100 mL of a 6 M stock solution of hydrochloric acid and need to prepare 500 mL of a diluted solution, you can solve for the required initial volume:

$$V_1 = \frac{M_2 V_2}{M_1} = \frac{(1\text{ M})(500\text{ mL})}{6\text{ M}} \approx 83.3 \text{ mL}$$

This means you would measure out about 83.3 mL of the 6 M stock and add water until the total volume reaches 500 mL. Mastering this calculation is essential for any quantitative lab work.

## Osmosis

Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane, from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration, until equilibrium is reached or a counteracting pressure stops the flow. A semipermeable membrane allows small molecules like water to pass freely but blocks larger solutes such as sugars, salts, or proteins. Because the solute cannot cross, water moves instead, diluting the more concentrated side. This process requires no metabolic energy — it is driven entirely by the random thermal motion of water molecules and the resulting difference in water concentration between the two sides.

**Worked example.** Picture a U-shaped tube divided by a semipermeable membrane. One side holds pure water; the other holds water with dissolved salt. Salt ions cannot cross the membrane, but water molecules can. On the salty side, solute particles occupy space and effectively lower the concentration of free water molecules compared to the pure-water side. Water therefore diffuses from the pure-water side into the salty side, raising the fluid level there. This continues until the hydrostatic pressure created by the rising column — called osmotic pressure — pushes water back at the same rate it enters, producing a stable equilibrium.

**Problem-solving application.** Osmosis explains familiar biological and everyday phenomena, and reasoning through it is mostly about tracking which side has more free water. Consider a red blood cell placed in three different fluids: pure water (hypotonic), a solution matching the cell's internal salt concentration (isotonic), and concentrated saltwater (hypertonic). In the hypotonic solution, water flows into the cell, which can swell and burst. In the isotonic solution, water moves equally in both directions, so the cell's volume stays stable — this is why intravenous saline solutions are carefully matched to blood's solute concentration. In the hypertonic solution, water flows out, causing the cell to shrink. The same logic applies to preserving food with salt or sugar: the high external solute concentration draws water out of bacterial and fungal cells, dehydrating and killing them. Whenever you see a concentration gradient across a membrane permeable only to water, predicting the direction of osmosis is simply a matter of identifying which side is more dilute — water always moves toward the more concentrated solution.

## Osmotic Pressure

Osmotic pressure is the pressure that must be applied to a solution to stop the net inward flow of solvent across a semipermeable membrane separating it from pure solvent (or a more dilute solution). A semipermeable membrane allows small solvent molecules, usually water, to pass through while blocking larger solute particles. Because the solute cannot cross, water tends to move from the side with lower solute concentration to the side with higher solute concentration, diluting the more concentrated solution. This movement, called osmosis, continues until the pressure difference across the membrane balances the concentration difference driving the flow.

The relationship is captured by the van't Hoff equation, which treats a dilute solution's osmotic behavior as analogous to an ideal gas:
$$\Pi = i M R T$$
where $\Pi$ is osmotic pressure, $i$ is the van't Hoff factor (number of particles the solute dissociates into), $M$ is molarity, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is absolute temperature. This formalism is justified because osmotic pressure is fundamentally a statistical/thermodynamic quantity tied to particle concentration, not a mechanical or procedural concept.

**Worked example.** Suppose a 0.150 M solution of glucose (a nonelectrolyte, so $i = 1$) is separated from pure water by a semipermeable membrane at $37°C$ (310 K), body temperature. Using $R = 0.0821 \text{ L·atm/(mol·K)}$:
$$\Pi = (1)(0.150\text{ mol/L})(0.0821\text{ L·atm/mol·K})(310\text{ K}) \approx 3.82\text{ atm}$$
This is a substantial pressure — roughly 3.8 times atmospheric pressure — explaining why cells must tightly regulate internal solute concentrations to avoid swelling or shrinking.

**Problem-solving application.** Osmotic pressure calculations are essential in biology and medicine, particularly for determining whether an IV solution is isotonic (safe), hypotonic (causes cell swelling/lysis), or hypertonic (causes cell shrinkage). For example, if a saline solution has a lower osmotic pressure than blood plasma (roughly 7.7 atm), infusing it intravenously would cause red blood cells to absorb water and potentially rupture. Pharmaceutical scientists use the van't Hoff equation to formulate IV fluids and eye drops that match the body's osmotic pressure, and food scientists use osmosis principles to design preservation methods, since high solute concentrations (as in salting or sugaring) draw water out of microbial cells, inhibiting spoilage.

## Reverse Osmosis

Osmosis is the natural movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from a region of lower solute concentration to one of higher concentration, driven by the difference in osmotic pressure between the two sides. Reverse osmosis (RO) does the opposite: by applying mechanical pressure greater than the osmotic pressure to the concentrated (salty or contaminated) side, water is forced to flow backward through the membrane, leaving dissolved salts, minerals, and most microorganisms behind. The membrane itself is not a simple filter with visible holes; it is a dense polymer layer that allows water molecules to pass while rejecting ions and larger dissolved species, so the applied pressure must exceed the natural osmotic pressure for net reverse flow to occur.

Consider a desalination plant treating seawater with an osmotic pressure of roughly 27 atmospheres. If the system applies 55 atmospheres of hydraulic pressure to the seawater side, the net driving pressure pushing water through the membrane is the applied pressure minus the osmotic pressure resisting it — about 28 atmospheres. This net pressure determines how much fresh water can be produced per unit time (the flux), which is why practical RO systems must be engineered with pumps capable of significantly exceeding the natural osmotic pressure of whatever solution they treat; a system designed for brackish groundwater (osmotic pressure often under 5 atm) needs far less pumping energy than one built for seawater.

This distinction is the core of most real-world RO problem-solving: given a feedwater's salinity, engineers estimate its osmotic pressure, then size the pump and membrane system so applied pressure comfortably exceeds it, while also accounting for concentration buildup near the membrane surface (fouling) that raises the effective osmotic pressure over time. A common troubleshooting scenario is a household RO unit producing unexpectedly little water — the diagnosis usually starts by checking whether the household water pressure has dropped below the level needed to overcome the membrane's rejection threshold, since even a properly functioning membrane produces almost no permeate once the pressure differential collapses. Applying this logic — comparing supply pressure against the solution's resistance — is what separates a working RO design from an underpowered one, whether in a global desalination facility or an under-sink drinking water filter.

## Payoff

Reverse osmosis is where the concept-book's thread on membranes, concentration gradients, and pressure finally pays off as engineering. Ordinary osmosis moves solvent across a semipermeable membrane from low-solute to high-solute concentration, driven by the difference in osmotic pressure, $\Delta\pi$. Reverse osmosis (RO) does the opposite: it applies mechanical pressure $\Delta P$ greater than $\Delta\pi$ to the high-concentration side, forcing pure solvent to flow backward across the membrane against its natural gradient, leaving dissolved salts, ions, and most organic molecules behind. This is the natural endpoint of the book because it synthesizes three ideas developed separately in earlier chapters — diffusion, membrane selectivity, and pressure-driven work — into a single device that does useful, measurable work on the real world: turning undrinkable water into drinking water.

The governing relation, $\Delta P > \Delta \pi = iMRT$ (van 't Hoff's approximation for osmotic pressure, where $i$ is the van 't Hoff factor, $M$ is molarity, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is temperature), is a genuine quantitative constraint: if applied pressure doesn't exceed the feed water's osmotic pressure, no purified water crosses the membrane at all, and the system fails. This is why the concept requires the formalism — it is a hard threshold, not just a helpful description.

This threshold is exactly what connects reverse osmosis to its downstream applications. In desalination, $\Delta\pi$ for seawater (roughly 35 g/L salt) sets a minimum operating pressure near 25 bar, which is why industrial plants require multi-stage pumps and energy-recovery devices — a direct, calculable consequence of the same equation. In municipal and household water purification, lower-salinity feedwater means a lower $\Delta\pi$ threshold, which is why consumer RO filters can run on ordinary tap pressure. In medical and laboratory contexts, such as producing ultrapure water for dialysis or pharmaceutical manufacturing, the same pressure-versus-concentration logic governs how aggressively contaminants must be excluded and at what energy cost.

From here, the richest direction to pursue is desalination: work through how $\Delta\pi$ scales with salinity, estimate the minimum pressure and energy cost for a real plant, and see why energy recovery, not membrane chemistry, is the binding constraint on making seawater desalination affordable at scale.

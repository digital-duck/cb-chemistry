## Carbon Tetravalence

Every carbon atom forms exactly four covalent bonds. This behavior, called tetravalence, follows directly from carbon's electron configuration: $1s^2\,2s^2\,2p^2$. Carbon has six electrons total, but only the four in its outer (valence) shell — two in the $2s$ orbital and two in the $2p$ orbitals — are available for bonding. To achieve a stable octet (eight valence electrons, matching the nearest noble gas, neon), carbon must gain, in effect, four more electrons by sharing them with other atoms. It does this by forming four single covalent bonds, or fewer bonds with some doubled or tripled in bond order, as long as the total bonding capacity sums to four.

Consider methane, $\text{CH}_4$. Carbon shares one electron with each of four hydrogen atoms, and each hydrogen shares its single electron back, giving carbon a full octet and each hydrogen a full duet. The same principle explains carbon dioxide, $\text{CO}_2$: carbon forms two double bonds, one with each oxygen atom. A double bond counts as two shared electron pairs, so two double bonds still total four bonds' worth of shared electrons — tetravalence is satisfied even though carbon is bonded to only two other atoms rather than four.

Tetravalence becomes a practical problem-solving tool when predicting molecular structure. Given a molecular formula, you can often deduce the connectivity by asking: how must carbon's four bonds be distributed to satisfy every atom's valence requirement? Take ethylene, $\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$. Each carbon needs four bonds total. If the two carbons form a double bond between them (using two of each carbon's four bonds), each carbon has two bonds remaining, which it uses to bond with two hydrogen atoms. This matches the formula exactly and correctly predicts the planar, double-bonded structure of ethylene, rather than, say, a single C–C bond with mismatched hydrogen counts.

This bond-counting method scales to more complex organic molecules. Before drawing a full structure, check that every carbon's bonds sum to four, every hydrogen's sum to one, and every oxygen's typically sum to two. Structures that violate this constraint are chemically impossible, making tetravalence a fast, reliable filter for eliminating incorrect candidate structures.

## Organic Compound

An organic compound is any molecule built primarily from carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen, along with common partners such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or halogens. Carbon's defining feature is its ability to form four stable covalent bonds and link to other carbon atoms in chains, branches, and rings, producing an enormous diversity of structures from a small set of elements. This is why over 20 million organic compounds are known, compared to a much smaller number of inorganic ones. Compounds lacking carbon-hydrogen bonds — like carbon dioxide, carbonates, or diamond — are classified as inorganic even though they contain carbon.

**Worked example.** Consider ethanol, $\mathrm{C_2H_6O}$, versus dimethyl ether, also $\mathrm{C_2H_6O}$. Both share the identical molecular formula, yet they behave completely differently: ethanol is a liquid that mixes with water and burns as fuel, while dimethyl ether is a gas used as a refrigerant and aerosol propellant. The difference lies in structure — ethanol has an -OH group attached to a carbon chain ($\mathrm{CH_3CH_2OH}$), while dimethyl ether has an oxygen bridging two methyl groups ($\mathrm{CH_3OCH_3}$). This illustrates a core principle of organic chemistry: molecular formula alone does not determine identity or properties — the arrangement of atoms (the structural formula) does. Compounds with the same formula but different structures are called isomers, and predicting or distinguishing them is a routine task in identifying unknown organic samples.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose a chemist isolates an unknown compound with formula $\mathrm{C_3H_8O}$ and needs to determine which of three possible isomers it is: 1-propanol, 2-propanol, or methyl ethyl ether. Rather than guessing, they apply functional group tests: adding sodium metal produces bubbling hydrogen gas if an -OH group is present (both propanol isomers react; the ether does not), while oxidation with a mild oxidizer converts 1-propanol to an aldehyde but 2-propanol to a ketone — distinguishable by further chemical tests or spectroscopy. This process of narrowing down structure from formula, functional groups, and reactivity is the practical skill organic chemists use daily, whether identifying a natural product, verifying a synthesis, or characterizing an unknown environmental sample.

## Hybridization

When two atoms form a bond, the electrons involved don't simply occupy the plain $s$ and $p$ orbitals you'd predict from an atom's electron configuration. Instead, atoms often mix, or "hybridize," their atomic orbitals into a new set of equivalent orbitals better suited for bonding. Hybridization explains why methane's four C–H bonds are identical in length and angle (109.5°), even though carbon's ground-state configuration ($2s^2 2p^2$) would naively suggest two unequal bond types from unequal orbitals.

The rule is straightforward: the number of hybrid orbitals formed equals the number of atomic orbitals mixed, and that number is determined by counting the atom's electron domains (bonding groups plus lone pairs). One $s$ and three $p$ orbitals combine to form four $sp^3$ orbitals (tetrahedral, 109.5°); one $s$ and two $p$ orbitals form three $sp^2$ orbitals (trigonal planar, 120°); one $s$ and one $p$ orbital form two $sp$ orbitals (linear, 180°).

**Worked example.** Consider ethylene, $\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$. Each carbon has three electron domains: two C–H bonds and one C=C bond (a double bond counts as one domain). Three domains → $sp^2$ hybridization → trigonal planar geometry with 120° bond angles. The unhybridized $p$ orbital on each carbon, left perpendicular to the plane, overlaps sideways with its neighbor to form the $\pi$ bond of the double bond, while the $sp^2$ orbitals form the $\sigma$ framework. This is why ethylene is flat and rigid — rotation around the C=C bond would break the $\pi$ overlap.

**Problem-solving application.** Given a molecule's Lewis structure, you can predict hybridization and geometry in three steps: (1) draw the structure and count electron domains around the atom of interest, (2) match that count to a hybridization scheme (2→$sp$, 3→$sp^2$, 4→$sp^3$), and (3) assign geometry accordingly, remembering that lone pairs count as domains but aren't shown in the final molecular shape. Try this on $\text{XeF}_4$: xenon has six domains (4 bonds + 2 lone pairs), giving $sp^3d^2$ hybridization and octahedral electron geometry — but square planar molecular geometry once the two lone pairs are placed opposite each other to minimize repulsion.

## Hydrocarbon

A hydrocarbon is a molecule made of only carbon and hydrogen atoms, bonded together by covalent bonds. Carbon's ability to form four stable bonds—with other carbons or with hydrogen—lets these molecules build up as straight chains, branched chains, or rings, producing enormous structural variety from just two elements. Chemists classify hydrocarbons by bonding pattern: alkanes contain only single bonds (saturated), alkenes contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond, alkynes contain at least one triple bond, and aromatic hydrocarbons (like benzene) contain a ring of alternating or delocalized double bonds. This classification matters because bond type directly determines reactivity, melting/boiling point trends, and how the molecule burns or reacts with other substances.

**Worked example.** Consider methane ($\text{CH}_4$) and ethylene ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$). Methane is a saturated alkane—each carbon uses all four bonds to hold hydrogens, so it is chemically stable and burns cleanly:
$$\text{CH}_4 + 2\text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$
Ethylene, by contrast, has a carbon-carbon double bond, leaving it "unsaturated." That double bond is reactive: it can open up and add other atoms across it, which is exactly how ethylene molecules link together into long chains to form polyethylene plastic. The same underlying logic—single bonds are stable and unreactive, double/triple bonds are reactive sites—explains why alkanes are used as fuels while alkenes are the building blocks (monomers) of the plastics industry.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you're given a hydrocarbon with the formula $\text{C}_4\text{H}_8$ and asked whether it's an alkane, alkene, or cycloalkane. First check the general saturation formula for an acyclic alkane, $\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n+2}$: for $n=4$, that would be $\text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}$. Since the given molecule has two fewer hydrogens, it must contain either one double bond (an alkene, matching $\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n}$) or one ring (a cycloalkane, which also fits $\text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n}$)—the molecular formula alone can't distinguish them, so you'd need additional structural information, such as a reaction test with bromine water (alkenes decolorize it rapidly; cycloalkanes do not). This kind of degree-of-unsaturation reasoning is a standard first step in identifying unknown organic compounds from formula data alone.

## Alkene

An alkene is a hydrocarbon containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond ($\text{C=C}$). This double bond consists of one sigma ($\sigma$) bond and one pi ($\pi$) bond, and it fundamentally changes both the geometry and the reactivity of the molecule compared to alkanes (which contain only single bonds). Each carbon in the double bond is $sp^2$ hybridized, forcing the four atoms directly attached to the two double-bonded carbons into a single plane, with bond angles near $120°$. The general formula for an acyclic alkene with one double bond is $C_nH_{2n}$, reflecting the "degree of unsaturation" — two fewer hydrogens than the corresponding alkane.

**Worked example.** Consider ethene, $C_2H_4$ (commonly called ethylene), the simplest alkene. Its structure is $H_2C=CH_2$: two carbons connected by a double bond, each bonded to two hydrogens. Ethene is planar, and rotation around the double bond is restricted — unlike the free rotation seen around single bonds in alkanes. This restricted rotation is the key structural fact that explains alkene reactivity: the $\pi$ bond, formed from unhybridized p-orbitals overlapping above and below the plane, is weaker than a $\sigma$ bond and is exposed, making it an accessible site for chemical attack.

**Problem-solving application.** Because the $\pi$ bond is electron-rich and weaker than a $\sigma$ bond, alkenes readily undergo addition reactions, where a reagent breaks the double bond and adds atoms to each carbon. Suppose you want to convert propene ($CH_3-CH=CH_2$) into 1,2-dibromopropane. You would react propene with bromine ($Br_2$): the $\pi$ bond breaks, and one bromine atom attaches to each of the two double-bonded carbons, yielding $CH_3-CHBr-CH_2Br$. This bromine addition test is also used diagnostically — if you add bromine water to an unknown hydrocarbon sample and the orange color disappears, you can conclude the sample contains a $C=C$ double bond, since alkanes do not react with bromine under these mild conditions. This distinguishes alkenes from alkanes using a simple, visible chemical test rather than structural analysis alone.

## Alkyne

An alkyne is a hydrocarbon containing at least one carbon–carbon triple bond, giving the general formula $C_nH_{2n-2}$ for an acyclic molecule with one triple bond. The triple bond consists of one sigma bond and two pi bonds, forcing the two triple-bonded carbons and their attached substituents into a linear, 180° geometry. This high electron density between the carbons makes alkynes reactive toward addition reactions, similarly to alkenes but often even more so, since the pi bonds can react sequentially. The simplest and most familiar alkyne is ethyne, $C_2H_2$, commonly known as acetylene, used in oxyacetylene welding torches because its combustion releases an unusually large amount of heat.

**Worked example.** Consider 2-butyne, $CH_3-C\equiv C-CH_3$. To name it, first identify the longest carbon chain containing the triple bond (four carbons: butyne), then number the chain to give the triple bond the lowest possible locant. Here the triple bond sits between carbons 2 and 3, so the compound is named 2-butyne (or but-2-yne). Its molecular formula is $C_4H_6$, consistent with $C_nH_{2n-2}$ for $n=4$. If we hydrogenate 2-butyne completely, adding two equivalents of $H_2$ across the triple bond, we obtain butane, $C_4H_{10}$ — each pi bond is broken and replaced with a C–H bond on each carbon.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you are given an unknown hydrocarbon with molecular formula $C_5H_8$ and asked to determine its degree of unsaturation and propose a structure. The degree of unsaturation formula, $\text{DoU} = \dfrac{2n+2-x}{2}$ (where $n$ is the number of carbons and $x$ the number of hydrogens), gives $\text{DoU} = \dfrac{2(5)+2-8}{2} = 2$. A triple bond accounts for two degrees of unsaturation by itself (equivalent to two double bonds), so a straight-chain alkyne such as 1-pentyne ($HC\equiv C-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3$) or 2-pentyne satisfies this formula without needing any additional rings or double bonds. This kind of formula-to-structure reasoning is a standard first step organic chemists use when interpreting mass spectrometry or NMR data on an unknown sample.

## Addition Reaction

An addition reaction occurs when two or more molecules combine to form a single product, with no atoms lost in the process. This typically happens when a molecule containing a multiple bond—a double bond ($\text{C=C}$) or triple bond ($\text{C}\equiv\text{C}$)—reacts with another substance that adds across that bond. The multiple bond is "unsaturated," meaning it has capacity to bond with more atoms; addition converts it to a more saturated structure, with one degree of bonding unsaturation consumed for each addition step. Because the reaction simply combines reactants without releasing any byproduct, addition reactions obey a strict mass and atom count: every atom present in the reactants appears in the product.

**Worked example.** Consider ethylene, $\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$, reacting with hydrogen gas in the presence of a metal catalyst (platinum or palladium):
$$\text{H}_2\text{C=CH}_2 + \text{H}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Pt}} \text{H}_3\text{C-CH}_3$$
The double bond breaks, and one hydrogen atom attaches to each carbon, producing ethane. Notice the atom economy: 2 carbons + 4 hydrogens + 2 hydrogens = 2 carbons + 6 hydrogens on both sides. This is exactly the reaction industrial chemists use to convert unsaturated vegetable oils into saturated fats (hydrogenation), and it is why "partially hydrogenated" appears on food labels.

**Problem-solving application.** Addition reactions are useful for identifying unknown structures and predicting products. Suppose a hydrocarbon with molecular formula $\text{C}_4\text{H}_8$ reacts with $\text{Br}_2$ and produces $\text{C}_4\text{H}_8\text{Br}_2$ with no loss of atoms. The fact that bromine added directly across a bond—rather than substituting for a hydrogen—tells you the starting compound must contain a double bond (an alkene), since only unsaturated compounds undergo addition this way. This logic is the basis of the bromine test: shaking an unknown hydrocarbon with bromine water and watching the orange color disappear confirms the presence of a $\text{C=C}$ or $\text{C}\equiv\text{C}$ bond. Chemists routinely use this test, along with counting atoms before and after a proposed reaction, to distinguish addition from substitution and to verify that a proposed mechanism is chemically valid.

## Polymerization

Polymerization is the chemical process by which small molecules, called monomers, join together through covalent bonds to form long-chain or network structures called polymers. A single monomer might contain just a handful of atoms, but once thousands of them link together, the resulting polymer can have dramatically different physical properties — strength, flexibility, melting point — even though its chemical composition is a simple repeating unit. This is why polyethylene, made entirely of repeating $-\text{CH}_2-\text{CH}_2-$ units derived from ethylene gas, behaves nothing like the gas it came from: it's a solid plastic used in everything from grocery bags to bulletproof vests, depending on chain length and arrangement.

There are two main mechanisms. In **addition polymerization**, monomers containing a double bond (like ethylene, $\text{CH}_2=\text{CH}_2$) open up that bond and link directly to neighboring monomers, with no atoms lost in the process. In **condensation polymerization**, monomers join by forming a new bond while releasing a small molecule as byproduct — typically water. Nylon forms this way: a diamine and a diacid react repeatedly, each new bond releasing one water molecule, building up a long chain of alternating units.

**Worked example**: Suppose you want to estimate the molecular weight of a polyethylene chain made from 5,000 ethylene monomers. Each ethylene unit ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$) has a molar mass of about 28 g/mol. Multiplying gives $5{,}000 \times 28 = 140{,}000$ g/mol — a molecular weight typical of commercial-grade polyethylene. This calculation illustrates a key problem-solving skill in materials chemistry: connecting a microscopic property (chain length, or "degree of polymerization") to a macroscopic, measurable one (molecular weight), which in turn predicts real-world behavior like viscosity and tensile strength.

**Application**: Engineers exploit this monomer-to-property relationship deliberately. If you need a more rigid plastic, you might promote cross-linking between chains (as in vulcanized rubber, where sulfur bridges connect polymer strands) or increase average chain length. If you need biodegradable packaging, you choose monomers whose condensation bonds are more easily hydrolyzed by water and enzymes. In each case, the underlying problem — designing a material with a target property — is solved not by inventing new atoms, but by controlling how identical building blocks are linked.

## Payoff

Polymerization is the process by which small, repeating molecular units — monomers — link together into long chains or networks, and it is the natural endpoint of this book because it is where every earlier concept converges into something you can build with. Bonding determines what monomers can link and how strongly. Reaction kinetics determines how fast chains grow and how their length distribution comes out. Intermolecular forces determine why the resulting material is a brittle plastic, a stretchy rubber, or a tough fiber. Thermodynamics determines whether the reaction proceeds at all and how much heat it releases at scale. Polymerization is not a new idea layered on top of these — it is what happens when you apply all of them at once to build something with emergent, tunable properties that no single monomer possesses on its own.

That convergence is what makes it useful across so many domains. In materials science, controlling chain length and cross-linking turns the same basic chemistry into anything from a flexible bag to a rigid composite. In medicine, biodegradable polymers are engineered so hydrolysis — a reaction you can model with the same kinetic tools used for smaller molecules — releases a drug on a controlled timeline. In biology, DNA and proteins are themselves polymers, so the logic of monomer sequence and folding you learn here transfers directly to genetics and biochemistry. In sustainability, understanding polymerization mechanisms is what allows chemists to design plastics that depolymerize cleanly for recycling instead of persisting as waste. In each case, the same question recurs: given a monomer and a set of conditions, what structure forms, and what properties follow from that structure? That is a problem-solving skill, not just a definition.

Pick one of these domains — materials, medicine, genetics, or sustainable design — and trace a specific polymer back to its monomer and reaction mechanism. Ask what would happen to the material's properties if you changed the monomer, the chain length, or the degree of cross-linking. That exercise is the best test of whether the concepts in this book have become tools you can actually use.

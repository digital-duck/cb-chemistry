## Molar Concentration

Molar concentration, denoted $c$ or $[X]$, measures how much of a substance is dissolved in a given volume of solution. It is defined as

$$c = \frac{n}{V}$$

where $n$ is the amount of solute in moles and $V$ is the volume of solution in liters, giving units of mol/L, commonly written as M (molar). This definition is a ratio, not merely a label — it lets chemists convert freely between the amount of a substance and the volume needed to deliver it, which is the basis of every titration, dilution, and reaction-stoichiometry calculation in the laboratory.

**Worked example.** Suppose 5.85 g of sodium chloride (NaCl, molar mass 58.5 g/mol) is dissolved in enough water to make 500 mL of solution. First convert mass to moles:

$$n = \frac{5.85\ \text{g}}{58.5\ \text{g/mol}} = 0.100\ \text{mol}$$

Then convert volume to liters ($500\ \text{mL} = 0.500\ \text{L}$) and divide:

$$c = \frac{0.100\ \text{mol}}{0.500\ \text{L}} = 0.200\ \text{M}$$

The solution is 0.200 M NaCl.

**Problem-solving application.** Molar concentration becomes especially powerful when solutions are diluted or mixed, since the moles of solute stay fixed even as volume changes. This gives the dilution relation

$$c_1 V_1 = c_2 V_2$$

For instance, a chemist has 100 mL of a 6.0 M HCl stock solution and needs to prepare 1.0 L of 0.50 M HCl for a titration. Solving for the required stock volume:

$$V_1 = \frac{c_2 V_2}{c_1} = \frac{(0.50\ \text{M})(1.0\ \text{L})}{6.0\ \text{M}} = 0.083\ \text{L} = 83\ \text{mL}$$

So 83 mL of the concentrated stock is measured out and diluted with water up to 1.0 L. This same logic — tracking moles as the invariant quantity while volume and concentration trade off — underlies buffer preparation, serial dilutions in microbiology, and dosage calculations in pharmacology, making molar concentration one of the most practically load-bearing quantities in quantitative chemistry.

## Reaction Rate

The rate of a chemical reaction measures how quickly reactants are converted into products, typically expressed as a change in concentration per unit time. For a reaction $aA + bB \rightarrow cC + dD$, the rate is defined so that it gives the same value regardless of which species you track:

$$
\text{rate} = -\frac{1}{a}\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -\frac{1}{b}\frac{d[B]}{dt} = \frac{1}{c}\frac{d[C]}{dt} = \frac{1}{d}\frac{d[D]}{dt}
$$

The negative signs on reactants reflect that their concentrations decrease over time, while products increase. Dividing by stoichiometric coefficients ensures the rate is a single, unambiguous number rather than one that depends arbitrarily on which molecule you happened to measure.

**Worked example.** Consider the decomposition $2N_2O_5 \rightarrow 4NO_2 + O_2$. Suppose experiments show $O_2$ forming at $2.5 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{mol/(L·s)}$. What is the rate of $NO_2$ formation, and how fast is $N_2O_5$ disappearing?

Using the coefficient ratios: the overall rate equals $\frac{d[O_2]}{dt} = 2.5\times10^{-3}$ mol/(L·s). Since $NO_2$'s coefficient is 4 versus $O_2$'s coefficient of 1, $NO_2$ forms four times faster: $\frac{d[NO_2]}{dt} = 4(2.5\times10^{-3}) = 1.0\times10^{-2}$ mol/(L·s). For $N_2O_5$, coefficient 2 means it disappears twice as fast as the overall rate: $-\frac{d[N_2O_5]}{dt} = 2(2.5\times10^{-3}) = 5.0\times10^{-3}$ mol/(L·s).

**Problem-solving application.** This relationship lets chemists convert between any two species' rates without needing separate measurements for each — a critical skill in lab settings where only one species (often a colored one, measured by spectrophotometry) is convenient to monitor directly. For instance, if a kinetics experiment reports that a reactant is consumed at a known rate, you can immediately predict how fast any product forms, or vice versa, purely from the balanced equation's coefficients. This also underlies rate-law experiments: when chemists say "the rate of reaction is $k[A]^n$," they mean the standardized rate defined above, not the raw disappearance rate of an arbitrarily chosen reactant — a distinction that matters when comparing rate laws across different sources or reactions with different stoichiometry.

## Rate Law

A rate law is an equation that expresses how the rate of a chemical reaction depends on the concentrations of its reactants. For a general reaction $aA + bB \rightarrow products$, the rate law takes the form

$$\text{rate} = k[A]^m[B]^n$$

where $k$ is the rate constant, and $m$ and $n$ are the reaction orders with respect to $A$ and $B$. A critical point students must internalize: $m$ and $n$ are **not** the stoichiometric coefficients $a$ and $b$. They must be determined experimentally, because they reflect the actual molecular mechanism of the reaction, not just its overall balanced equation. The sum $m+n$ gives the overall reaction order.

**Worked example.** Consider the reaction $2\text{NO}(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{NO}_2(g)$. Experiments give the following data:

| Trial | $[\text{NO}]$ (M) | $[\text{O}_2]$ (M) | Initial rate (M/s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.010 | 0.010 | $2.5\times10^{-5}$ |
| 2 | 0.020 | 0.010 | $1.0\times10^{-4}$ |
| 3 | 0.010 | 0.020 | $5.0\times10^{-5}$ |

Comparing Trials 1 and 2, $[\text{NO}]$ doubles while $[\text{O}_2]$ is held constant, and the rate quadruples ($2^2=4$), so $m=2$. Comparing Trials 1 and 3, $[\text{O}_2]$ doubles while $[\text{NO}]$ is held constant, and the rate doubles ($2^1=2$), so $n=1$. The rate law is therefore

$$\text{rate} = k[\text{NO}]^2[\text{O}_2]$$

with overall order 3. Substituting any trial's values back in solves for $k$: using Trial 1, $2.5\times10^{-5} = k(0.010)^2(0.010)$, giving $k = 25\ \text{M}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$.

**Problem-solving application.** Once the rate law is known, it becomes a predictive tool. Suppose $[\text{NO}]$ is tripled and $[\text{O}_2]$ is halved from the original conditions in Trial 1. The new rate is

$$\text{rate}_{\text{new}} = k(3[\text{NO}])^2(0.5[\text{O}_2]) = 9 \times 0.5 \times \text{rate}_{\text{original}} = 4.5 \times \text{rate}_{\text{original}}$$

This "method of initial rates" — isolating one concentration's effect at a time — is the standard technique for determining unknown rate laws from experimental data, and mastering it is essential for interpreting reaction mechanisms in later coursework.

## Integrated Rate Law

A rate law like $\text{rate} = k[A]$ tells you how fast a reaction is going at a single instant, but it doesn't directly answer a question chemists care about most: how much reactant is left after a given amount of time? The **integrated rate law** answers this by converting a differential rate expression into an equation for concentration as a function of time.

For a first-order reaction, $A \rightarrow \text{products}$, the rate law is $-\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]$. Using calculus, this differential equation integrates to:

$$\ln[A]_t = \ln[A]_0 - kt$$

or equivalently $[A]_t = [A]_0 e^{-kt}$. This exponential decay form is intrinsic to first-order kinetics — it isn't optional notation, it's what "first-order" mathematically means. Other reaction orders have their own integrated forms: zero-order gives $[A]_t = [A]_0 - kt$ (a straight line in $[A]$ vs. $t$), and second-order gives $\frac{1}{[A]_t} = \frac{1}{[A]_0} + kt$ (a straight line in $\frac{1}{[A]}$ vs. $t$).

**Worked example.** Suppose a drug in the bloodstream decomposes by first-order kinetics with $k = 0.0231\ \text{hr}^{-1}$, and the initial concentration is $[A]_0 = 80\ \mu\text{mol/L}$. What is the concentration after 24 hours?

$$\ln[A]_{24} = \ln(80) - (0.0231)(24) = 4.382 - 0.554 = 3.828$$

$$[A]_{24} = e^{3.828} \approx 46\ \mu\text{mol/L}$$

**Problem-solving application.** The real power of integrated rate laws is diagnostic: if you have concentration-vs-time data but don't know the reaction order, plot $\ln[A]$, $[A]$, and $\frac{1}{[A]}$ separately against $t$. Whichever plot is linear reveals the order, and its slope gives $k$ directly (slope $= -k$ for first-order, $= -k$ for zero-order, $= +k$ for second-order). This is exactly how pharmacologists determine drug elimination kinetics, how environmental scientists model pollutant decay, and how you can predict, for any future time, exactly how much reactant — or drug, or contaminant — remains, rather than only knowing its rate at one instant.

---

## First Order Kinetics

A first-order reaction is one whose rate depends on the concentration of a single reactant raised to the first power. If $A$ is the reactant, the rate law is $\text{rate} = k[A]$, where $k$ is the rate constant (units of inverse time, such as $\text{s}^{-1}$). This is a genuinely mathematical concept — its defining feature is a differential equation — so the formalism below is necessary, not decorative.

Starting from $-\dfrac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]$, separating variables and integrating gives the exponential decay law:

$$[A]_t = [A]_0 \, e^{-kt}$$

Taking the natural log of both sides yields a linear relationship, $\ln[A]_t = \ln[A]_0 - kt$, which is why a plot of $\ln[A]$ versus $t$ producing a straight line is the standard experimental test for first-order behavior. A defining consequence of this law is that the half-life, $t_{1/2} = \dfrac{\ln 2}{k}$, is *constant* — independent of the starting concentration. This is the single most useful diagnostic: if successive half-lives are equal, the process is first-order.

**Worked example.** A drug in the bloodstream degrades with a first-order rate constant $k = 0.231\ \text{hr}^{-1}$. Starting from an initial concentration of $80\ \mu\text{g/mL}$, find the concentration after 6 hours and the half-life.

Half-life: $t_{1/2} = \dfrac{\ln 2}{0.231} \approx 3.0\ \text{hr}$.

Concentration at $t=6$: $[A]_6 = 80\,e^{-0.231(6)} = 80\,e^{-1.386} \approx 80(0.25) = 20\ \mu\text{g/mL}$.

Notice that 6 hours is exactly two half-lives, and $80 \to 40 \to 20$ confirms the answer without even using the exponential formula directly — a useful sanity check.

**Problem-solving application.** First-order kinetics governs radioactive decay, drug elimination (pharmacokinetics), and many chemical reactions. The practical skill is recognizing which piece of data you're given and solving for the unknown: if you know two concentrations and the elapsed time, solve for $k$ using $k = \dfrac{\ln([A]_0/[A]_t)}{t}$; if you know $k$, use $t_{1/2}=\ln 2/k$ to predict how long a substance takes to fall to any fraction of its original amount, since every additional half-life simply halves whatever remains.

## Second Order Kinetics

A reaction follows second-order kinetics when its rate depends on the concentration of a single reactant raised to the second power, or on the product of two different reactant concentrations each raised to the first power. In the simplest case, rate $= k[A]^2$, where $k$ is the rate constant with units of $\text{M}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}$ — notice these units differ from first-order kinetics ($\text{s}^{-1}$), a quick diagnostic when identifying reaction order from data.

Starting from the rate law $-\dfrac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]^2$, separating variables and integrating gives the integrated rate law:

$$\frac{1}{[A]_t} = \frac{1}{[A]_0} + kt$$

This equation is the workhorse of second-order kinetics: it predicts concentration at any time $t$, and — because it's linear in $1/[A]_t$ versus $t$ — it gives experimentalists a direct way to confirm second-order behavior. If a plot of $1/[A]_t$ against $t$ produces a straight line, the reaction is second order, and $k$ is simply the slope.

**Worked example.** Consider the gas-phase decomposition $2\text{NO}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{NO} + \text{O}_2$, which is second order in $\text{NO}_2$ with $k = 0.543\ \text{M}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}$ at a given temperature. If $[\text{NO}_2]_0 = 0.200\ \text{M}$, find the concentration after 60 seconds.

$$\frac{1}{[A]_t} = \frac{1}{0.200} + (0.543)(60) = 5.00 + 32.58 = 37.58\ \text{M}^{-1}$$

$$[A]_t = \frac{1}{37.58} \approx 0.0266\ \text{M}$$

**Problem-solving application.** A useful derived quantity is the half-life, $t_{1/2} = \dfrac{1}{k[A]_0}$. Unlike first-order half-life, this one depends on the starting concentration — a critical distinction when comparing reaction behaviors. This matters practically: a second-order reaction slows dramatically as reactant is consumed, since each successive half-life takes longer than the last (unlike first-order, where half-life is constant). When analyzing unknown kinetic data, chemists test both the first-order ($\ln[A]$ vs. $t$) and second-order ($1/[A]$ vs. $t$) linear forms; whichever plot is straighter reveals the true rate law. This diagnostic technique is standard practice in determining reaction mechanisms in both academic and industrial settings, such as characterizing degradation rates of pharmaceuticals or pollutants.

## Zero Order Kinetics

In chemical kinetics, the *order* of a reaction describes how the rate depends on the concentration of a reactant. A reaction follows zero-order kinetics when its rate is constant — independent of the reactant's concentration. This happens whenever the rate-limiting step doesn't involve free reactant molecules colliding in solution but instead depends on a fixed, saturated resource: an enzyme active site fully occupied by substrate, a catalytic surface with no open binding spots, or a light source delivering a constant photon flux. Because the mechanism producing the reaction, not the amount of reactant present, sets the pace, doubling the concentration doesn't speed anything up.

Mathematically, the rate law is

$$\text{rate} = -\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k$$

where $k$ is the rate constant (units of concentration/time). Integrating gives a linear decay:

$$[A]_t = [A]_0 - kt$$

This is the defining signature of zero order: a plot of concentration versus time is a straight line, in contrast to the exponential decay of first-order kinetics.

**Worked example.** An enzyme-catalyzed reaction is running at saturating substrate concentration, so $[A]_0 = 10\ \text{mM}$ and $k = 0.5\ \text{mM/min}$. After 8 minutes, $[A]_8 = 10 - (0.5)(8) = 6\ \text{mM}$. Notice the drop is the same 4 mM whether we look at the first 8 minutes or the next 8 minutes — the rate never slows down until the enzyme becomes unsaturated near depletion.

**Problem-solving application.** A clinical example: ethanol metabolism in the human body is zero order at typical drinking concentrations, because liver enzymes (alcohol dehydrogenase) are saturated. Suppose blood alcohol concentration (BAC) starts at 0.08% and clears at $k = 0.015\%/\text{hr}$. To find when BAC reaches the legal limit for driving after a stricter threshold, say 0.02%, solve the linear equation directly:

$$0.02 = 0.08 - 0.015t \implies t = \frac{0.08 - 0.02}{0.015} \approx 4\ \text{hours}$$

This linear, additive structure is the practical payoff of recognizing zero-order behavior: elapsed time to reach any target concentration is a simple subtraction-and-division calculation, with no logarithms required — unlike first-order decay, where the same question would require solving an exponential equation.

## Half Life

Radioactive decay is a random process at the level of individual atoms — there is no way to predict when a specific unstable nucleus will decay — but at the scale of trillions of atoms, this randomness produces remarkably reliable statistical behavior. The half-life $t_{1/2}$ of a radioactive isotope is the time required for half of the nuclei in a sample to decay. This constancy makes decay one of the few natural processes that follows a strict exponential law: the amount of remaining substance $N(t)$ after time $t$ is

$$
N(t) = N_0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / t_{1/2}}
$$

where $N_0$ is the initial quantity. Equivalently, $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$, where the decay constant $\lambda = \ln 2 / t_{1/2}$ gives the probability per unit time that any given nucleus decays.

**Worked example.** Carbon-14 has a half-life of about 5,730 years. Suppose an ancient wooden artifact contains 22% of the carbon-14 found in living wood. To find its age, solve for $t$:

$$
0.22 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/5730} \implies t = 5730 \cdot \frac{\ln(0.22)}{\ln(0.5)} \approx 12{,}500 \text{ years}
$$

This is exactly how radiocarbon dating works: the ratio of remaining carbon-14 to stable carbon-12 tells archaeologists how long ago an organism died.

**Problem-solving application.** Half-life reasoning generalizes far beyond nuclear physics — any process with a constant *proportional* rate of decrease follows the same math. Drug elimination in the body, radioactive tracer clearance in medical imaging, and even the decay of a technology's market relevance can be modeled this way, using an effective half-life for the process. For instance, if a medication has a half-life of 6 hours and a patient takes 400 mg, the amount remaining after 18 hours is $400 \cdot (1/2)^{18/6} = 50$ mg — useful for determining safe redosing intervals. A practical skill worth mastering: given any two of $\{N_0, N(t), t, t_{1/2}\}$, you can always solve for the fourth by taking logarithms, since the exponential relationship is monotonic and invertible. This is the same technique used to compute a "half-life" for population decline, pollutant breakdown, or capacitor discharge — recognizing the underlying pattern lets you transfer one mathematical tool across many disciplines.

## Radioactive Decay Kinetics

Radioactive decay is a random process at the level of any single nucleus, but at the scale of a real sample — billions of atoms — it obeys a precise, predictable law. Each unstable nucleus has a fixed probability per unit time of decaying, called the decay constant $\lambda$, independent of the sample's age, temperature, or chemical environment. Because every atom decays independently with the same probability, the population as a whole shrinks in a way that mirrors continuous exponential decrease elsewhere in nature (drug elimination, capacitor discharge, cooling). The number of undecayed nuclei $N(t)$ satisfies the differential equation $\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N$, whose solution is $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$. This is the one place in the section where a genuine mathematical law is unavoidable: the exponential form is not a modeling choice, it is the direct consequence of a constant per-nucleus decay probability.

**Worked example.** Iodine-131, used in thyroid treatment, has a half-life of 8.0 days. Half-life $t_{1/2}$ relates to $\lambda$ by $\lambda = \frac{\ln 2}{t_{1/2}}$, giving $\lambda \approx 0.0866\ \text{day}^{-1}$. Suppose a hospital receives a 100 mg dose. After 24 days (three half-lives), the remaining amount is $100 \times (1/2)^3 = 12.5$ mg — or equivalently, $100\,e^{-0.0866 \times 24} \approx 12.5$ mg. Both routes agree because half-life and $\lambda$ encode the same physical constant.

**Problem-solving application.** The practical skill is inverting the exponential to find elapsed time — the basis of radiometric dating and medical dosimetry. Solving $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$ for $t$ gives $t = \frac{1}{\lambda}\ln\left(\frac{N_0}{N}\right)$. Carbon-14 dating uses this directly: if a bone sample retains 30% of its original $^{14}\text{C}$ (half-life 5730 years), then $\lambda \approx 1.21\times10^{-4}\ \text{yr}^{-1}$, and $t = \frac{1}{1.21\times10^{-4}}\ln(1/0.30) \approx 9950$ years. The same equation, run forward, tells a hospital physicist how long to store radioactive waste before it drops below a safety threshold, or how much of a tracer isotope remains active at the moment of a scan. The recurring problem-solving move is always the same: identify $N_0$, $N$, and either $\lambda$ or $t_{1/2}$, then solve the exponential relationship for whichever quantity is unknown.

---

## Payoff

Radioactive decay kinetics is where the entire toolkit of this book converges: exponential functions, differential equations, half-life reasoning, and probabilistic modeling all meet in a single physical process that is simple to state and rich to apply. The governing law, $\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N$, says that the rate at which unstable nuclei transform is proportional to how many are left. Solving it gives $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$, and from that one equation flows the half-life $t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}$, the mean lifetime $\tau = 1/\lambda$, and every downstream calculation you will ever need for decay problems. It is the natural endpoint of the book because it is the cleanest possible illustration of exponential change acting on a real, measurable, consequential system — and because mastering it means you have internalized the differential-equation reasoning that underlies population growth, cooling, drug clearance, and compound interest as well.

The applications branch out from this single kinetic law. In radiometric dating, measuring the present ratio of a parent isotope to its daughter product and inverting $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$ lets geologists and archaeologists assign ages to rocks, fossils, and artifacts spanning thousands to billions of years. In nuclear medicine, the same equation governs how quickly a diagnostic tracer or therapeutic isotope loses activity in the body, which determines dosing schedules and imaging windows — choose an isotope with too short a half-life and the signal disappears before the scan finishes; too long, and the patient carries unnecessary radiation exposure. In nuclear reactor and waste management, decay kinetics determines how "hot" spent fuel remains over time and how long storage must last before radioactivity drops to safe levels, directly shaping engineering and policy decisions.

Each of these is the same mathematics wearing a different lab coat. If you want to see the law solve a genuinely high-stakes problem, spend your next session on radiometric dating: work through how scientists dated the age of the Earth using the decay of uranium into lead, and notice how a single differential equation became one of the most consequential measurements in the history of science.
